第1章 译序


　　你期待新世界吗？

　　《美妙的新世界》是英国作家奥尔德斯·伦纳德·赫胥黎于1932年出版的科幻小说。把它归类为科幻小说，是因为本书描画的主题是未来世界。在那个世界，工业与科学的过度发达导致了人类社会的畸变：看似和谐稳定，内在却充满了冷漠与阴暗，道德沦丧，人性消亡。

　　在作者描绘的世界里，孕育、母亲、父亲，这些维系人类社会的伟大词汇，变成了肮脏下流、腐败落后的渣滓。每一个人都是实验室里技术人员配置的结果，你的身高、你的性别、你的生理缺陷、你对疾病的抵抗能力，甚至你的命运，都在试管和烧瓶里已然被决定了。胚胎分为由低到高的不同种姓，接受不同的训练。低种姓者矮小丑陋，承担社会里最低层的工作；高种姓者高大漂亮，构成社会的上层。在新世界里，每个人都很快乐。但这种快乐不是自由意志选择下的结果，所有社会成员的快乐一模一样，没有选择，也没有空间包容别样的快乐。

　　书里的几个主要人物都有自我意识觉醒的时刻，列宁娜半夜醒来，发现枕头下传来睡眠教育的录音，从而思考背后的意义；飞过焚化炉时，亨利·福斯特突然感叹每一道热风都代表一条生命永恒的消逝。但这些时刻转瞬即逝，他们终归又回到新世界里快乐而麻木的人群中去。而那些回不去的人，作者也没有安排他们成为颠覆社会秩序的英雄。野蛮人约翰自杀，贝尔纳和亥姆霍兹被送去了孤岛。

　　如果本书仅仅是一部纯科幻小说，那么它绝不会被誉为“二十世纪最伟大的一百部英语小说之一”。在科幻小说的外壳下，作者探讨的是物质文明泛滥时人类社会的发展方向。书中刻画未来社会的笔触充满了讽刺与绝望。精神由物质主宰，人性自由被技术和秩序消解，反抗只是恢宏乐章下的片刻杂音，刹那间即被淹没。这种对技术发展的反思，对人类命运的忧虑，使得本书成为二十世纪“反乌托邦”文学里的一面旗帜。

　　另外值得一提的是，本书从头到尾充满了各种奇妙的隐喻：“brave new world”的书名出自莎士比亚名作《暴风雨》；绝大部分角色的名字都实有其人，美国汽车大王福特（ford）取代了上帝god……

　　由于中英文两种语言的差异，加上翻译时间及译者水平的有限，本书可能并未能完全体现原文的所有精妙之处，在此，特向读者致以深切的歉意。原文主旨宏阔、寓意深远，但愿手中粗劣之笔不影响读者对原文的理解，本人便心满意足了。

第2章 (1)


　　一幢只有三十四层的灰白色矮楼。入口处的一行大字十分醒目：中央伦敦培育所与条件设置中心。大字旁的盾牌图案上我们看见了世界国的格言：社会，和谐，稳定。

　　一楼大厅面朝北方。现在是夏天，户外的气温低得反常，可室内却热得像在赤道一样。一道纤细而又锐利的光线穿透了窗户，试图找寻某种被布盖上的苍白的人体模型或是长着鸡皮疙瘩的学者形象，但这种尝试被证明是徒劳无功的。屋里只有实验室的玻璃、镍和黯淡的陶瓷。寒冷回应着寒冷。工人们穿着白色的大褂，手上戴着白色的橡胶手套，这种白通常只有在尸体上才能看到。光线在此刻冻结了，死亡了，如幽灵一般。只有在显微镜焦黄的镜头下，才能找到某种丰润的生命物质。它躺在一排排光亮的试管里，像黄油一样，往辽远处无限延伸。

　　“这，”主任开了门，“就是受精室。”

　　他是培育与条件设置中心的主任。此时，受精室里一片安静，三百个孕育员弯腰靠在仪器上，有的人全神贯注；有的人则心不在焉地自言自语，还吹着口哨。主任身后是一群新来的学生。他们年轻而稚嫩，粉红的脸蛋，紧张的神态，一看就知道涉世未深。每个人手上都有一个笔记本，疯狂地记下主任所说的每一个字。可以亲耳听到伟大人物的教诲是多么罕见的特权啊！中央伦敦培育与条件设置中心主任始终相信：必须亲自带领他的新学生们参观每一个部门。

　　“只是让你们对全局有大致的了解。”他向学生们解释道。因为如果想要出色地完成工作（即便这些工作有点儿微不足道），就必须了解些总体情况。只有这样，他们才有可能成为社会中和谐、快乐的成员。众所周知，美德与幸福源自细节；而全局则是理智上的必要之恶。社会的脊梁永远是锯工和集邮者，而不会是哲学家。

　　“明天，”主任微笑地看着他们，可这种亲切里却混杂了一丝威胁。他继续说道：“你们马上就要投身于严肃的工作中，将不再有时间了解全局。与此同时……”

　　与此同时，这也是一种特权：话语从大人物的口中直接落到笔记本的扉页上。学生们疯狂地记着。

　　主任朝屋里走去。这个男人修长、瘦削，身姿挺拔，下巴很长，大门牙向外突出，不说话时勉强能被厚厚的嘴唇包住。他是年老？年轻？三十岁？五十岁？五十五岁？很难说。不过在弗德纪元632年这个安定的时代里，没有谁会去问一问。

　　“我将从头说起，”主任说道。更多积极的学生在笔记本上记下了这位大人物的话：从头说起。“这些，”他挥了挥手，“是培育器。”打开绝缘门，主任开始向孩子们展示一架架已经编好号的试管。“这全都是本周供应的卵子，必须保持在——”他解释道，“血液温度；而男性精子的温度，”这时，他开了另一道门，“则必须保持在三十五度而不能是三十七度。血液温度对它们来说太高，会导致所配精子失去繁殖功能。”要知道，热度箱里的公羊是不可能配出崽的。

　　主任靠在培育器上，对现代的授精过程做着简述。学生们的铅笔在本子上匆匆划过，一页又一页。外科手术，当然是简述里的第一项——“手术不仅对社会有益，同时也可以为个人带来一笔价值其半年工资的高额报酬。”然后，主任谈到了保证剥离卵巢存活的技术；对于最佳温度、最佳盐度及最佳黏度的考量，还有存放剥离下来的成熟卵子之用的特殊液体。此时，他把那群年轻人领到了工作台前，向他们现场展示这种特殊液体从试管里抽取的过程；一滴滴注入经过特殊加温处理的显微镜玻片上；检视液体中卵子的异常性；卵子计数；如何将其移至一种指定的带孔容器内；把此容器浸入到有活跃精子的浓稠液体中（此时，在主任的带领下，学生们兴致勃勃地观看了这项技术的操作过程）——他一再强调指定液体里的精子密度至少为十万\/立方厘米。浸泡十分钟后，从液体里取出带孔容器，再次检验其中的培育状况。如果依然存在未受精卵，则需进行二次浸泡，如有必要，还可执行第三次浸泡操作。最后受精卵将回到培育器里。三十六个小时后，取出伽玛、德尔塔和伊普西龙的卵子执行“波卡程序”，而阿尔法类和贝塔类的卵子则将继续留在培育器里直到最终入瓶。

　　主任强调了一遍：“波卡程序。”受教的年轻人们纷纷在笔记本里对这个词划上了重点记号。

　　一个卵子——一个胚胎——一个成人，这是自然界的常规。但卵子经过波卡程序的处理后会产生出芽、增殖、分裂等变化，最终生成八至九十六个胚胎，每个胚胎最终都能发育成一个健全的成人。现在，九十六个人诞生于一个受精卵，而从前一个卵子只能孕育出一个人。多么伟大的进步啊！

　　“本质上来说，”主任总结道，“波卡程序是对生物发育的抑制。对卵子进行波卡处理后，我们再来观察它的成长状态，令人惊讶的结果：出芽。”

　　出芽。铅笔又开始忙碌起来。

　　主任继续指点着。眼前，一条传送带把装满试管的货架缓缓地送入巨大的金属柜中，此时在传送带的另一端，出现了又一个满载试管的货架。轻微的轰隆轰隆的声音，这是机器运行的声音。主任对这幅画面补充道：“试管通过金属柜需要八分钟。”八分钟的强力x光照射通常是卵子可以承受的最大照射量。照射过程中，一些卵子会死亡。在剩下的卵子里，最不敏感的卵子会一分为二，而其他大部分卵子会出芽产生四个胚胎，有些则是八个。然后，它们又会全部被送回培育器等待胚胎继续发育。两天之后，培育器里的卵子们将被突然冷冻、抑制生长。二——四——八，出芽后的胚胎再次出芽；随之用酒精使它们再次濒临死亡，结果是胚胎的第三次出芽——胚胎再次长出新胚胎，新胚胎又生长出新胚胎——此时，如果继续进行抑制程序，一般会造成胚胎的集体死亡。所以，余下的工作便是任其自由生长。到这个阶段，原始卵已经分裂成八至九十六个胚胎。这是自然界里巨大的飞跃，我想你们会同意这个观点。完全相同的多个胚胎，不同于母体分娩时代的双胞胎或三胞胎，它们只是产生于卵子的偶然分裂。现在，一个卵子最终会变成几十甚至上百个人。

　　“上百个！”主任伸展开双臂，犹如在抛洒金币一般，“上百个！”

　　有个孩子不识实务地问道：“那么，好处在哪儿呢？ ”

　　“我的好孩子！”主任猛地转过身，面对这个蠢蛋：“难道你看不出来？难道你连这也看不出来？！”他举起一只手，脸上带着庄严的表情：“波卡程序是稳定社会的主要工具！”

　　稳定社会的主要工具。

　　标准化的男性和女性，都是批量培育的产物。这样，一个“波卡”卵子就能满足一整个小工厂的工人需求。

　　“九十六个一模一样的多胞胎同时操控九十六部一模一样的机器！”由于内心里一股莫名的热忱，主任的声音几乎颤抖了起来。“你们真正明白了自己在社会里的位置，这是历史的新开端。”他引用了世界国格言：“社会，和谐，稳定。”这些字眼多么有分量。“如果波卡程序能够被无穷尽的执行，我们的世界还会有任何问题吗？”

　　标准化的伽玛、标准化的德尔塔、标准化的伊普西龙，数以百万计的标准化多胞胎能解决所有的问题。工业里的标准化大规模生产原则终于——终于在生物学里运用了！

　　“但是，唉！”主任摇摇头，“波卡程序有尽头。”

　　“波卡”卵子的分裂极限是九十六，平均值是七十二。这已经是一枚卵子受精（使用同一名男性的精子）而批量生成标准化多胞胎的最好成绩（遗憾的是，这只能够算是次好成绩），虽然如此，可是往往连这样的成绩都很难达到。

　　“两百个卵子自然成熟需要三十年之久。但目前的任务只是稳定人口，此时的，此地的。难道我们还需要为了表现科学的进步而耗费四分之一个世纪吗？”

　　显然没有必要。但是新的“破瓷”技术大幅度提高了成熟速率。有了“破瓷”技术，我们就可以保证两年之内生产出至少一百五十个成熟的卵子。卵子受精之后经过波卡处理——用数字表示，就是全部乘以七十二，这样平均能得到一万一千个胚胎，即两年之内出生一百五十批一模一样的多胞胎。

　　“甚至存在用一个卵子培养出一万五千个成年人的特例。”

　　一个浅色头发的强壮男子刚好路过这群庞大的学习队伍。主任对他招了招手，叫道“福斯特先生”，那青年走了过来。“福斯特先生，你能向大家说明我们实验室的培育纪录么？”

　　“本中心的最高纪录，同一个卵子培育出了一万六千零一十二个胚胎。”福斯特先生立马回答道，没有一丝犹豫。他的蓝眼睛里闪烁着愉悦的光彩，显然这是个热爱数字的人。“一万六千零一十二个，共是一百八十九批多胞胎。当然，那些位于赤道地区的培育中心，”他滔滔不绝地继续说道，“数量会更多。新加坡常常超过一万六千五百个，而蒙巴萨已经突破了一万七千的纪录。不过，他们是靠着不公平的优势。你们要是能看到黑人卵子对脑垂体的活跃反应就好了！简直是惊人！但凡是习惯了使用欧洲材料作业的人都会十分震惊。可是，”他大笑了声（眼神里闪现着战斗胜利的光彩，翘起的下巴也颇有几分挑战意味），“可是，我们还是企图超越他们。目前，我正在培养的德尔塔减型卵子，才十八个月，已经有了一千九百个孩子，有的已经换瓶，有的还处于出芽分裂状态，个个都很健壮。我们一定会超过他们的。”

　　“这就是我喜欢的精神！”主任拍了拍福斯特先生的肩膀，高声说道：“来吧，和我们分享你的专业知识，让这些孩子受益终生。”

　　福斯特先生谦虚地笑了笑：“再乐意不过了，主任先生。”

　　装瓶室，喧闹而和谐，忙乱而有序。小电梯从位于地下第二层的器官库处升起，发出“吱——吱”的声音，运送着已经切割成适当大小的母猪腹膜片（全都是新鲜的）。“咔哒”，电梯门从中间打开，腹膜片顺着传送带飘了出来。装瓶工伸出一只手，抓起腹膜片，插进瓶里，压平，才刚刚把瓶子放到传送带上，就听见了又一声“咔哒”！电梯门打开，一块新的腹膜片从里面送了出来，等待着被塞进新的瓶子——传送带上漂流着无穷无尽的瓶子中的一个。

　　装瓶工旁边的是收纳员。生命的制造进程前进着。卵子们脱离了试管，进入了更大的容器；精准地撕开腹膜衬，桑葚胚从中落了出来，毫无意外地落入容器中，然后灌入盐溶液……到了这个阶段，瓶子里的工序就结束了，接下来轮到标签工跟瓶子外表较劲。遗传状况、授精日期、波卡分组的细节等等信息需从试管转移到瓶子外。从此，这些生命不再是匿名的了，它们被署上了名，标上了身份。生命的进程继续缓缓地前进着，穿过了墙壁上的一道开口，来到了“社会性参数前定室”。

　　“卡片索引文件的体积总共有八十八立方米。”福斯特先生这句满溢得意之情的句子同大家一同步入了社会性参数前定室。

　　“这个数据当然是包括了全部的相关资料。”主任补充道。

　　“每天早上资料都会更新。”

　　“每天下午还要再次调整。”

　　“根据数据进行计算。”

　　“每个种群的个体数量。”福斯特先生说。

　　“分配的量。”

　　“每个时刻的最佳出瓶率。”

　　“意外损耗的迅速补充。”

　　“迅速补充！”福斯特先生又重复了一遍，“你们得知道，上次日本地震之后，我们可加了不少班。”他温和地笑了笑，然后摇了摇头。

　　“社会性参数设定员把数据发给授精员。”

　　“等着授精员给他们合适的胚胎。”

　　“参数设定员对送来的胚胎瓶进行详细的设置。”

　　“然后再把瓶子送到胚胎库房办理入库。”

　　“也正是我们现在的目的地。”

　　福斯特先生领着大家，开了一道门，走下台阶，来到了地下室。

　　赤道似的灼热高温。他们越走越暗，身处的这条通道设有两道门及两个拐弯，目的就是确保地下室不受任何光线的破坏和侵扰。

　　“胚胎就像胶卷，”在推开第二道门时，福斯特先生诙谐地说道，“它们都只能面对红色的光线。”

　　实际上，他们进去的地方到处都是暗红色，那种暗红就好像夏天午后在阳光下闭上眼的感觉。一排排、一层层排列整齐的烧瓶反射着暗红的光线，像无数的红色宝石。在烧瓶架间行走的人群，每一个都是暗红色的幽灵，紫色的眼眸，似乎每个人都是狼疮患者。机器运转所发出的声响使空气也轻微地颤抖起来。

　　“福斯特先生，给他们几个数字。”由于长时间的教导，主任已经不太想开口了。

　　福斯特先生则十分喜悦，因为他热爱数字。

　　长为二百二十米、宽二百米、高十米，福斯特先生指了指上头。像小鸡喝足水抬头一样，学生们纷纷抬头望向高处的天花板。

　　架子有三层：地面走廊、一层走廊、二层走廊。

　　蛛网似的钢制走廊一层一层向前延伸，消失在黑暗里。架子边，三个暗红色的幽灵正忙着从电梯上取下烧瓶。

　　电梯来自社会性参数设置室。

　　放瓶子的架子一共有十五个。同时，可能你们没有发现，每个架子也都是一条传送带，传送速度为每小时三十三点三厘米。二百六十七天，每天八米，算下来总共是两千一百三十六米。地下室的一条环道同地面走廊同高，一条同一层走廊同高，另外还有半条同二层走廊同高。在第二百六十七天的清晨，当阳光照进换瓶室的时候，“独立生命”就诞生了。

　　“但是在现在的阶段，”福斯特先生总结道，“我们已经投入了很多的精力。嗯，相当相当多的精力。”他笑了，笑声里张扬着洞悉与胜利。

　　“这就是我喜欢的精神！”主任又一次说到这句话，“我们一起再转转。你，福斯特先生，跟他们说说所有的东西。”

　　福斯特先生尽职地讲解。

　　他向学生们介绍了腹膜床上的胚胎；让他们尝了尝给胚胎食用的黏稠的代血浆；解释了为什么需要用胎盘素和甲状腺激素的刺激；说明了黄体素的提取过程；带领他们参观喷射口（这种喷射口每隔十二米就自动喷射一次黄体素）；谈到了在全程（长度为二千零四十米）的最后九十六米处，将逐渐增加脑垂体黏液。描述了一百一十二米处向每个烧瓶内放入人工母体循环器；让他们看了代血浆储存库，保证液体流过胎盘、合成肺及废物过滤器的离心泵。此外，还涉及了胚胎极有可能产生贫血，因此需要供应大量的猪胃提取液及马胚胎的肝。

　　学生们来到了一台简单的仪器前，每过六米，这台仪器会摇晃胚胎瓶，目的在于使它们能适应移动。福斯特先生介绍了在换瓶过程中可能遭遇的风险及种种预防措施，即对瓶里的胚胎进行适应性训练。另外，他还解释了在二百米左右进行的性别测试及标签体系。字母t代表男性，o代表女性，而白底上打了黑色问号的将注定成为没有生育能力的女性。

　　“当然，”福斯特先生说，“在绝大部分情况下，良好的生育机能没有任何意义。一千二百个卵子里只要有一个多产卵就能满足需求。不过如果想保证每个胚胎都是精挑细选的结果，还是得保险点儿。所以，最多有百分之三十的女性胚胎可以正常发育。剩下的，在接下来的过程中，每隔二十四米就会被注射一定剂量的雄性激素。最终的结果就是到了换瓶阶段，我们得到了身体机能正常的不孕女性。”不过福斯特先生也不得不承认，“这些注射过雄性激素的女性后来都有一种轻微的长胡子的倾向，但可以保证，她们没有任何的生育能力。”福斯特先生继续道：“这些带领我们走出了对自然的模仿（这种模仿还停留在奴隶阶段，把自然当做主人）从而真正进入了人类发明的世界。”

　　福斯特先生搓了搓手。培育出胎盘当然不是他们的全部目标，这是连母牛都能做到的事情。

　　“我们还能设置人的各项条件以及决定他的社会命运。通过换瓶，胚胎就拥有了社会身份，成为了阿尔法或伊普西龙中的一员，也就是未来的下水道工人或……”福斯特先生原本想说“统治世界”，可话到嘴边却改了口，“做未来的培育中心主任。”

　　培育中心主任微笑着接受了这句赞美。

　　一行人经过了位于三百二十米处的第十一号货架。一个年轻的贝塔减技工正忙着用螺丝刀和扳手处理瓶子里的代血浆泵。随着他拧紧螺丝，马达的嗡嗡声也变得更加低沉。往下，往下……最后再拧一下，随即看了一眼循环台，任务完成。他沿着传送带走了两步，开始处理下一个胚胎瓶。

　　“减少每分钟的旋转次数，”福斯特先生继续解释着，“就等于降低了代血浆的循环速度，这样一来它们流经肺部所需的时间增加，输送的氧气总量也就减少。对于达到抑制胚胎的生物机能而言，没有比减少氧气量更好的方法了。” 说完，福斯特先生再次搓了搓手。

　　“为什么要抑制生物机能？”一个天资聪颖的学生提问道。

　　“笨蛋！”过了很久，主任终于开口，“难道你想不出来伊普西龙的胚胎必须得有伊普西龙环境和伊普西龙遗传吗？”

　　这名学生显然从来未曾想过这个问题，因此感到分外的惶恐和疑惑。

　　“种姓越低，”福斯特先生说，“供氧量越少。大脑是最早被影响的器官，随即是骨骼。供氧量减少三成，胚胎就会发育成侏儒；如减少七成以上，我们将得到没有眼睛的怪胎。”

　　“也就是完全没有价值的废物。”福斯特先生总结道。

　　“然而，”福斯特先生的语气既谨慎又热切，“如果能发明一种技术能够缩短胚胎的成熟期，这将是多么伟大的壮举，对社会，又是多么大的贡献啊！”

　　“想想马这种动物。”

　　学生们听话地立刻开始思考。

　　马的成熟期为六年，大象十年，而人到十三岁也没有真正进入性成熟阶段，要等到二十岁才完全成熟。当然，身体发育上缓慢带来的是智力上的高度发展。

　　“但伊普西龙胚胎，”福斯特先生用一种公正的口吻陈述着，“并不需要人类的智慧。”

　　“既不需要，也根本没有。十岁时，伊普西龙的智力发育就已经结束不再继续，可身体发育却需要十八年时间。也就是十八岁后，他们的身体条件才能满足工作要求。这么长的身体发育期是极其浪费的。如果我们能够加快他们的身体发育速度，比如跟牛一样的成熟期，我们的社会将节省多少资源！”

　　“不可思议！”学生们受到了启发，低声议论着。福斯特先生话语里隐含的热忱感染了他们。

　　接下来的讲话偏重技术方面。福斯特先生开始说明内分泌失调导致的发育迟缓，原因可能是胚胎期的突变。这种突变的影响是否能消除呢？是否可以通过某种技术使伊普西龙的胚胎出现返祖现象，拥有如狗或牛般的常态？这就是问题的重点。不过，这个问题已经基本上解决了。

　　在蒙巴萨，皮尔金顿实验室已经成功培育出四岁性成熟、六岁半发育完成的个体。这是科学领域毋庸置疑的一次胜利，但还不能投入实际应用。六岁人愚蠢至极，连伊普西龙人的工作都做不了。而这个科学程序却是不可折中的，除了不变和彻底的改变，没有其他的选项。实验员们仍然在尝试在二十年及六年的成熟期区间里寻求一个平衡点，不过到目前为止都没有任何进展。福斯特先生不由得叹了口气，摇了摇头。

　　他们继续在暗红色的光线里进行生命的漫步。他们来到了位于一百七十米处的九号架附近，马上就要走到尽头了。此时，眼前出现了一个隧道，隧道上有很多两三米宽的开口，胚胎瓶在狭长的隧道里停止了漂流。

　　“开口的作用是调节温度。”福斯特先生解释道。

　　冷、热隧道交替地排列。冰冻加重了强力x射线造成的不适。这些胚胎在换瓶时经历了刺骨的寒冷。经过社会性参数设置，这些胚胎将来会出现在热带地区从事矿工、人造丝缫丝工及钢铁工人的工作。过后，还要训练他们的精神，这样才能更好地支持身体。“通过设置不同的条件，我们会让这批胚胎适应炎热的气候，在高温中茁壮成长，”福斯特先生最后总结道，“楼上的同事们会培养他们爱上这种炎热。”

　　“那就是，”主任引用了句格言，“那就是‘幸福与美德在于——热爱一切无法改变的事情。’这也正是所有参数、条件设置的目的：让人们爱上逃脱不了的社会命运。”

　　在两条隧道中间，一名护士正在用细长的针管仔细地检查每个瓶子里的凝胶物质。参观者们安静地观察着。

　　“嗯，列宁娜。”看到护士抽回针管站直了身子，福斯特先生终于开了口。

　　那姑娘吓了一跳，转过身子来。尽管满室暗红色的光线令她的皮肤像得了狼疮一样，眼睛也变成了紫色，她的美丽却依然让人注目。

　　“亨利！”列宁娜朝他投去了微笑，露出了贝齿。

　　“迷人，迷人！”主任喃喃自语道，然后轻轻地拍了拍她，得到了一个恭敬的微笑。

　　“你在加什么？”福斯特先生刻意专业地问道。

　　“啊，是普通的伤寒和昏睡症疫苗。”

　　“在一百五十米处，要对赤道工人胚胎注射疫苗。”福斯特先生向学生们解释道。“这时胚胎还有鳃。注射了疫苗，以后就不会患上相关的疾病。”说完，他转向了列宁娜，“今天下午四点五十分在楼上，”他说，“照旧。”

　　“迷人。”主任重复了一遍，最后又拍了列宁娜一下，接着和别人一起走开了。

　　第十号货架上未来的化学工人胚胎正在接受一系列训练提高对铅、苛性钠、沥青和氯的忍耐度。第三号货架上的是未来的航天工程师，一批二百五十个，刚刚经过了一千一百米处的标牌。一种特殊的机器使它们的胚胎瓶一直保持旋转的状态。“为了增强他们的平衡能力，”福斯特先生解释道，“在太空里修理火箭可是件十分困难的事情。他们直立时，我们就放慢代血浆的循环速度，这样胚胎们就会处于半饥饿状态；他们倒立时，我们则会加倍地供应代血浆。这样，他们会形成倒立和舒适相联系的条件反射。于是，只有倒立时，他们才能感受到真正的快乐。”

　　“现在，”福斯特先生继续说道，“我要给你们展示阿尔法加知识分子的性格设置，十分有趣。在一层走廊的五号架上有一大批阿尔法加。一层走廊！”他朝已经往地面走廊走去的两个男孩子叫道。

　　“在九百米附近，”福斯特先生解释道，“在胚胎的尾巴消失以前是没法进行智力条件设置的。请各位跟随我来。”

　　此时，主任看了看他的表。“三点差十分，”他说，“恐怕没有时间看知识分子胚胎了，我们得在孩子们午觉结束前回到育婴室。”

　　福斯特先生有些失望。他请求道：“至少看一下换瓶室吧。”

　　“那好吧，”主任温和地笑了笑，“那就看一眼吧。”

第4章


　　培育与条件设置中心主任和他的学生们走进了电梯，留下福斯特先生在换瓶室里。

　　育婴室。牌子上写着“新型巴甫洛夫条件设置室”。

　　主任打开了门。进门后，他们来到了一个巨大的没有遮蔽的房间。一整面南墙都是透明的玻璃，明亮的阳光照亮了屋子里的每个角落。六个护士正忙着把玫瑰花摆放到地板上。她们统一地穿着白色制服（纤维胶亚麻的上衣和长裤），头发收进了白色的帽子里。玫瑰花被密集地种植在巨大的花盆里。数以千计的花瓣弥漫着成熟的丝质光泽，好像小天使的脸庞。在明亮的光线下，这些脸庞并不都是雅利安型和粉红型，其间还有灿烂的中国型和墨西哥型。有些花瓣天使可能是在天堂里吹了太多的喇叭，形态僵硬的如同中风病人；还有些苍白到带上了死亡的气息，同大理石一样病态的苍白。

　　看到主任，护士们马上站直了。

　　“把书拿出来吧。”主任吩咐道。

　　在一片静谧中，护士们把幼儿用书摆放到了巨大的玫瑰花盆间。每本书都是摊开的，书页上满满都是自然界飞禽走兽的美丽色彩。

　　“现在，把孩子们带进来。”

　　护士们匆匆忙忙地走出房间。两分钟她们回来，每人都推着一部手推车。推车上有四层钢丝网架，每层都躺着一名婴儿，全都八个月大，全都一模一样（显然是和谐组波卡化的胚胎）。因为这些婴儿属于德尔塔，所以一律穿着卡其色的衣服。

　　“把他们放到地板上。”

　　婴儿们被转移到了地板上。

　　“现在，把他们转过来，让他们看看玫瑰和书本。”

　　刚转过身时，婴儿们突然变得特别安静，然后就被书页上丰富的色彩和形状所吸引，朝它们爬了过去。在他们靠近的过程中，之前遮住太阳的那片云飘走了，阳光又一次充满了整个房间。玫瑰花好像突然迸发了生命内在的热情，变得更加明媚艳丽，书页在阳光的抚摸下仿佛也焕发了新的光彩。婴儿们喜欢眼前看到的生动景象，发出了激动的叫声和欢快的笑声。

　　主任搓了搓手。“棒极了！”他说，“简直像提前训练过似的。”

　　婴儿中速度最快的那个已经到达目标了。他努力地伸出小手，摸着，抓着，玫瑰花变了形，花瓣扯掉了，书本也被揉皱了。主任在旁静静地等待着。终于，所有的婴儿们都开心地忙碌起来时，他举起手发布了指令。“你们看着吧。”

　　早早就站在房间另一头的护士长收到了指令，按下了仪表盘上的按钮。

　　剧烈的爆炸声、汽笛声、警铃声纷纷响起，极度地刺耳。

　　婴儿们害怕得尖叫起来，小脸也因为恐惧而变形、扭曲。

　　“现在，”因为巨大的噪音，主任不得不大声地吼叫，“现在用轻微的电击来复习一下刚才的教训。”

　　主任再次挥了挥手，护士长随即按下了第二枚按钮。婴儿们的尖叫声也随之变了调，声音里夹杂着绝望甚至疯狂。小小的身子开始痉挛，逐渐僵硬，四肢颤抖起来，好像有看不见的线在拉扯。

　　“这整片地板都可以通电，”主任大声地解释道，“但是，已经够了，”他又做了个手势。

　　爆炸声停止了，汽笛和警报的尖锐声音也渐渐平息。婴儿们放松了僵硬的身体，已经减弱的啜泣和呜咽却又变成了惊吓时的哭嚎。

　　“再给他们花和书。”

　　护士们按照主任的命令行事。可是当玫瑰花和书页里色彩鲜艳的小猫、小鸡、黑山羊才刚刚开始靠近，婴儿们就吓得躲避起来，哭喊的声音也突然更加刺耳。

　　“观察，”主任说道，像赢得了某种胜利，“观察。”

　　书本与噪音，花朵与电击——这些东西在婴儿的内心里已经勉强地结合到了一起。经过两百次这样类似的训练后，婴儿就会形成不可逆的条件反射。这种人造的联系连自然也是无能为力的。

　　“这种婴儿时期建立的条件反射，也就是心理学家称之为‘本能’的东西，将伴随他们长大。整个成长过程中，他们都会厌恶书籍和鲜花。条件反射是不可逆的，也就是说他们一辈子都无需害怕书籍和植物的危险。”说完，主任转过身面对着护士，“把他们带走吧。”

　　这些婴儿又重新被塞回车上，尽管他们仍然在哭喊着。手推车被推走了，留下的是婴儿身上已经发酸的奶味和此时此刻被大家无比珍惜的宁静。

　　一位学生举起手提问道：“我十分理解禁止让低种姓的人在书本上浪费时间（何况这时间根本不属于他们个人，而属于全体社会），况且读书实在太危险了，很有可能破坏他们经过长期的训练而生成的条件反射，但是关于那些花……晤，我实在不能理解那些花，为什么要花尽力气去让德尔塔婴儿厌恶花朵呢？ ”

　　培育及条件设置中心主任对这个问题耐心地做出了解答，训练那群婴儿厌恶玫瑰花是出于经济上的考量。很久以前（其实不能算做很久，仅仅才相距一个世纪），伽玛、德尔塔甚至伊普西龙其实是被训练成喜欢花朵的，确切地说，是喜欢自然，目的就是让他们产生亲近自然的欲望，使他们不得不花费更多的钱在交通上。

　　“交通消费扩大了吗？”学生问。

　　“相当大，”主任回答道，“但是，仅仅是交通费。”

　　月见草和风景，主任进一步指出道，都有一个致命的缺点：免费。对大自然的爱使工厂根本繁忙不起来。于是热爱大自然的训练被废除了（至少在低种姓的人群中），但是交通消费却不能取消，这是极为重要的。必须让他们去农村，即使厌恶也得去。关键是为交通消费找出一个经济上更为恰当的理由，而不是喜欢月见草或风景。幸运的是，我们找到了。

　　“我们让群众厌恶乡村，”主任总结道，“与此同时，训练他们喜欢一切乡村运动。另外，我们还注意提高所有乡村运动器材的损耗率；这样一来，他们既得在交通上花费钱财又得消费工业用品。因此，我们使用了电击。”

　　“我明白了。”学生沉默了，迷失在对主任以及对这项政策的崇敬里。

　　大家安静了一会儿后，主任清了清嗓子，继续说道：“从前，在我主弗德仍然在世时，有一个小孩，名叫热本·拉宾诺维奇。他的父母说波兰语，”主任插了句题外话，“我想，你们应该知道什么是波兰语吧？”

　　“是一种已经消失的语言。”

　　“与法语和德语一样。”另一个学生做了补充，炫耀自己知道这些已经消失语言的名字。

　　“那‘父母’呢？”主任继续发问。

　　沉默，突如其来的尴尬，好几个小伙子的脸都涨红了。他们还不会分辨粗俗与纯科学之间巨大而微妙的差异。最后，终于有一个勇士举起了手。

　　“人类以前是……嗯……”他犹豫了，感觉全身的血液都涌上了脸颊，“以前是胎生的。”

　　“非常正确。”主任朝他点点头以示赞许。

　　“胚胎换瓶时……”

　　“‘出生’时。”主任出声纠正了这名学生的不当用词。

　　“嗯……他们是父母生——我想说，跟现在的胚胎不一样，当然是不一样；他们是其他那些。”小伙子慌张到不知道自己在说什么。

　　“总之呢，”主任说道，“父母，也就是‘爸爸’和‘妈妈’。”粗俗才是真正的科学。这个观念让孩子们陷入了一片难堪的沉默，彼此都不敢注视对方的眼睛。“妈妈，”主任有意打破了沉默，往椅子上一靠，“这些，”他严肃地说道，“都是令人不愉快的事实。不过，历史就是由这些不愉快的事实所构成的。”

　　话题又回到了小热本身上——小热本。某个晚上，由于疏忽，小热本的爸爸妈妈离开时，忘记了关掉小热本房间里的收音机。

　　（因为你们得知道，在当年那个野蛮的胎生时代，那个还没有国家条件设置中心的年代里，孩子们都是被所谓的“爸爸妈妈”抚养长大的。）

　　小热本进入了梦乡，这时，突然响起了伦敦的广播节目。第二天早上，发生了一件令他的爸爸妈妈惊讶不已的事（又一次听到这个粗俗的词汇，人群中甚至有几个粗俗大胆学生心有灵犀地咧嘴笑了起来）。起床后，小热本居然开始背诵起一位古怪老作家的长篇演说，而且一字不差。那是乔治·贝尔纳·萧的作品（“少数几个仍有作品流通的作家，其余古老年代的作品都已经因为思想问题被禁止出现在市面上。”），他通过传统的笔触表现了自身的天赋。小热本背诵这篇著名演讲的时候，又眨眼又怪笑。因为小热本这些怪异的表现还有一直嘟囔着的根本听不懂的语言，他的父母马上把他带到了医生那儿。幸运的是，医生会说英语，听到小热本的自言自语后，马上就联想到了前一天晚上广播里播放的萧·贝尔纳的演讲。此事具有重大的医学价值，于是这名医生便致信医学刊物报告了此事。

　　“睡眠教学，或者睡眠学习法的原理就这样被发现了。”说完这句话后，主任有意停顿了一下。

　　从原理的发现到真正的实际推广和应用，这两者又间隔了漫长的岁月。

　　“小热本的案例是在我主弗德的t型车进入市场之后二十三年出现的。”（此时，主任在肚子上画了个t字，学生们也虔诚地照做。）“可是……”

　　学生们又在笔记本上疯狂地写着。“睡眠教学的第一次正式应用却是在弗德纪元二一四年。如此早地发现，如此晚地应用，其间原因有两个。”

　　“第一，先行者们搞错了方向。”主任说道，“他们认为睡眠学习法是智力开发的手段之一……”

　　一个小男孩在床上休息。他向右侧卧着，手臂垂落在床边，床边的小盒子里轻轻地流出了一段录音：

　　“尼罗河的长度为非洲第一，世界第二，仅次于密西西比河。但是其流域长度却为世界之首，穿越了三十五个纬度。”

　　第二天早餐时，有人问：“汤米，非洲最长的河是什么河？”对方摇摇头。“那你记得以‘尼罗河……’开头的那句话吗？”

　　“尼罗河的长度为非洲第一，世界第二，仅次于密西西比河。”这些字句不经思索就脱口而出。

　　“那么，现在你知道了，非洲最长的河是什么河？”

　　“我不知道。”

　　“是尼罗河，汤米。”

　　“尼罗河的长度为非洲第一，世界第二，仅次于密西西比河。”

　　“那么，汤米，最长的河是哪一条呢？”

　　小男孩着急地哭喊着：“我不知道！”

　　主任解释道，正是那声无助而急切的哭泣声使当时的研究人员最终决定放弃实验。至此之后，再也没有科研人员尝试在孩子们睡觉时进行尼罗河的地理教育了。而这才是正确的。每个人都不可能掌握科学，如果他不了解科学到底是为了什么。

　　“如果他们当初选择进行道德教育就好了。”主任领着学生们向门口走去。学生们在纸上拼命写着：“道德教育无论如何也不应该是理性的。”

　　“安静。”十四层，电梯门打开，人群走了出来，听到扩音喇叭低沉的声音，“安静。”每一条走廊里都能听到这样的声音，不断地重复着。不仅是学生们，连主任都下意识地垫起了脚尖，小心翼翼地行走着。当然了，他们都是高种姓的阿尔法，但即使是他们，在胚胎时间及成长过程里也是被充分地训练过的。“安静”，十四楼的空气里似乎都弥漫着命令的气息。

　　就这样小心翼翼地走了快五十米，他们来到了一道门前。主任轻轻开了门，跨过门槛，进入了一个光线昏暗的宿舍，昏暗是因为百叶窗全都被拉上了。墙边摆了八十张小床，排成一排。均匀的呼吸和持续的低语，好像是来自无限遥远处的微弱之声。

　　一个护士看到他们进屋就立刻站了起来，走到主任面前，立正站好。

　　“下午上的什么课？”

　　“前四十分钟是《性学基础》，”她回答道，“现在是《阶级意识启蒙》。”

　　主任慢慢地走着，观察小床上躺着的孩子。他们呼吸轻柔，显得自在而放松。每个枕头下都有一个小小的扩音器，播放着指定的内容。主任在一张小床前停下了脚步，俯下身子，认真地听着。

　　“刚才你说的是《阶级意识启蒙》？用喇叭让大家都听听。”

　　主任走到了墙边，摁了下按钮。

　　“……都穿绿色，”广播开始了，声音温柔清晰，“而德尔塔儿童则穿卡其色。噢，我可不想和德尔塔一起做游戏。伊普西龙更糟，他们太蠢了，连读写都不会；另外，他们还穿黑色，多么粗鄙的颜色。真高兴我是个贝塔。”

　　广播停顿了一下，又继续播放起来。

　　“阿尔法的儿童衣着是灰色。他们的工作很辛苦，因为他们比我们聪明。我很幸运我是贝塔，这样我就不用辛勤地劳动。而且我们要优于伽玛和德尔塔。伽玛十分愚蠢，穿着绿色衣服，德尔塔穿着卡其色衣服。我不愿意和他们一起玩耍。伊普西龙要糟糕得多，他们是十足的笨蛋…”

　　主任按下按钮关掉了广播，扩音喇叭里的声音消失了，可那声音依然存在于那八十个枕头里。

　　“今天，这些内容还要重复播四五十遍，星期四、六还要复习巩固。三十个月，每周三次，每次一百二十遍，然后这个课程就结束了。接下来，他们会接受更高级的训练。”

　　玫瑰花与电击，德尔塔人的衣服颜色是卡其色……在孩子们学会说话之前，这些事物间的联系便深深地刻进了他们的意识里。但是，普通的条件设置是很笼统的，不可能达到教育他们区别微妙差异及学习复杂行为的效果。所以必须加上语言，非理性的语言。简而言之，必须有“睡眠学习法”。

　　“这是历史上最伟大的道德与社会化的力量。”

　　这些话，每一字每一句，全都化成了年轻人的笔记。

　　主任又打开了广播。

　　“聪明得吓人，”一个温和且永远不知疲倦的声音说道，“我超级高兴，因为我是贝塔，因为……”

　　有人用“水滴石穿”来形容这种训练模式，其实不太恰当。虽然水以柔克刚的力量是大家有目共睹的。准确地说，它更像蜡滴：干脆地落下——缓缓地封住——逐渐坚硬起来。蜡油会和落下的地方融为一体，把岩石包成个红疙瘩。

　　“这种训练让孩子们的思想里只有接受到的信息，所有这些信息也就构成了他们的思想。不仅是此时的思想，也是未来的思想——贯穿整个人生。可以说，以后他们对事情的判断全都来源于这些信息。而这些伟大的信息正是经过我们安排的信息！”说到这儿，主任愈加激动起来，“我们接受国家的旨意而安排的。”他不禁捶了下身旁的桌子。“接下来的……”

　　不和谐的噪声响起，主任不得不回过了头。

　　“啊，弗德！”他的声调不再激动，“我只顾着自己居然把他们都弄醒了。”

第5章 (1)


　　游戏时间，地点：花园。六月天的酷热让花园里的六七百个孩子脱光了衣服。这些男孩女孩们有的在草地上奔跑、嬉闹，有的聚在一起玩球，有的则躲进了开着鲜花的灌木丛中。玫瑰正热烈地绽放，夜莺在森林里密语，树上的布谷鸟欢乐地歌唱。一种有节奏感的嗡嗡声（这声音来自近处的蜜蜂和远处的直升机）给夏日增添了一种懒洋洋的困意。

　　经过“调皮狗离心球”的时候，参观的人群停了下来。这个游戏的核心设备是一座铬钢塔。皮球被扔到塔顶的小平台上，落进塔里，被高速旋转的圆盘甩出来。二十个孩子为一组围着钢塔，小球一旦飞出便争先恐后地抢夺。

　　结束了观察后，大家纷纷转身离开。主任暗自思考着：“真想不通为什么在过去的年代，绝大部分的游戏只需要一两个球、几根棍子，顶多再加上一张网。这些玩意儿对促进消费可没有任何贡献，简直毫无意义。现在，如果一个新游戏所需要的设备比现有的游戏简单，根本就不可能问世。”正想着，思绪突然被别的事物打断了。

　　“那几个小家伙多可爱。”他指着远处。

　　手指之处，有两丛繁茂高大的地中海石楠，中间是一小片草地。一名七岁左右的小男孩和另一名比他略微大上一岁的女孩正以科学家致力科研的精神玩着性的启蒙游戏。

　　主任被眼前的景致打动了：“迷人，迷人！”

　　“迷人。”学生们附和着大人物，但笑容里却有着明显的优越感。不久前他们刚刚脱离这种幼稚的把戏，所以又看到的时候，难免有些过来人的轻蔑。迷人？不过只是孩子气的胡闹而已。

　　“我始终认为……”主任刚开口，就被一阵“哇哇”大哭所打断。

　　从旁边的小树林里走出来了几个人。一个护士牵着个号啕大哭的小男孩，后面小跑着跟着一个满脸焦急的小姑娘。

　　“怎么了？”

　　护士耸了耸肩：“没什么。只是他不太愿意参加性游戏，以前有过两三次，没想到今天又犯了。就在刚才，他开始大叫……”

　　“我，真的，”跟在最后的小女孩着急地解释道，“我没有任何伤害他的意思，真的。”

　　“亲爱的，你当然没有。”护士柔声安慰着小女孩，“所以，”她转过身，面对着主任，“现在，我要带他去心理助理主任那儿检查一下他究竟是哪儿不正常。”

　　主任赞许道：“很好！带他过去吧。小姑娘，你留下来。”在护士带走了男孩之后，主任继续问道：“你叫什么名字？”

　　“玻莉·托洛茨基。”

　　“好名字！走吧，再找一个小伙伴陪你玩刚才的游戏。”

　　那姑娘蹦蹦跳跳地跑向灌木丛，消失在视野里。

　　“可爱的小家伙！”主任看着小女孩逐渐远去的背影，转过身看着学生们说道，“我现在要说的，也许难以置信。但是，大多数情况下，历史都是让你们啧啧称奇的。”

　　主任开始讲述那件令人惊讶的事情。在弗德纪元前漫长的时期里，儿童之间的性游戏都被视为不正常的表现（人群中爆发出一阵阵笑声）；有时不仅是不正常，甚至被视作不道德、羞耻，因此被严厉地压制着。

　　在场的人都露出了不可思议的表情：难道让小家伙们享受一下快乐也是罪恶吗？简直是天方夜谭。

　　“甚至像你们这样的少年都禁止有性游戏的权利……”，

　　“不可能！”

　　“除了私下里不为人知的自慰和同性恋行为，其他什么都不可能。”

　　“一切？”

　　“通常，二十岁以后才有这些权利。”

　　“二十岁？”学生们异口同声地叫了出来。

　　“二十岁。正如我开头所说的，这确实是让人不敢相信。”

　　“后来呢？结果呢？”学生们追问道。

　　“结果很可怕。”一个陌生的厚实的声音插了进来。

　　不知何时，人群旁多出了个陌生人——中等个头，黑发鹰鼻，嘴唇丰厚，目光犀利而幽深。

　　“很可怕。”他又重复了一次。

　　已经在花园的钢架塑胶长凳上坐下来的主任（这种供人休息的凳子在园子里随处可见），在发现那个陌生人的一刻，立马就站了起来。他展开双手，向那人跑了过去，大门牙也因为夸张的笑容露了出来。

　　“总统！多么美丽的惊喜！孩子们，你们还愣着干吗？这是总统，是穆斯塔法·孟德阁下。”

　　此时，中心的四千个房间里同时响起了电子钟报时的声响。四点了。播音喇叭里传来了无形的声音：

　　“早班下班，晚班接班；早班下班……”

　　亨利·福斯特和参数设置中心的助理主任一同前往更衣室。在电梯里，两人碰上了心理局来的访客。看清来者是声名狼藉的贝尔纳·马克斯后，二人便立即移开了脸。

　　机器运行时微弱的轰鸣声轻轻地震动着胚胎室里暗红的空气，轮班的人不断交替着，一张狼疮病人似的面孔替换了另一张，而传送带则永恒地前进，承载着未来的男人与女人们。

　　列宁娜·克朗往门边轻快地走去。

　　尊敬的穆斯塔法·孟德阁下！学生们的眼睛几乎要从眼眶里蹦出去了。穆斯塔法·孟德，西欧总统，世界上仅有的十个总统之一！总统坐在了主任先前坐的长凳上，他打算要待上一会儿。是的，他想跟他们说说话……这些话语将直接来自权威，直接来自总统阁下。

　　两个穿着褐色衣服的孩子从树林里冒了出来，大大的眼睛里满是惊讶，看了一会儿，就又回到树林里快乐去了。

　　“你们全都记得，”那个厚实的声音继续说道，“我想，你们全都记得，我主弗德那句美丽又充满启示的话：历史全是废话。历史，”他语速缓慢地说道，“全是废话。”

　　他挥了挥手，仿佛拿着一柄无形的拂尘。拂尘一甩，一些灰尘被扫去了。那些灰尘里有巴基斯坦的哈拉帕，有迦勒底的乌尔；扫走了蜘蛛网，就是底比斯、巴比伦、克诺索斯和希腊的迈锡尼。再扫——奥德修斯、约伯、丘庇特、乔达摩和耶稣不知了去向。再扫——扫开了雅典、罗马、耶路撒冷和中央王国的古老尘埃。扫，弗德纪元前的意大利变成了空城。扫，教堂不见了；扫，李尔王与帕斯卡的思想消逝了。扫，激情；扫，安魂曲，扫，交响曲；扫……

　　“晚上去看感官剧吗，亨利？”助理主任问道。“我听说阿罕布拉那儿上映了一部大受好评的感官剧。有场爱情戏是在熊皮毯上，听他们说那场戏棒极了，熊皮上的每一根毛发都能看得清清楚楚，前所未有的触感体验。”

　　“这也就是不给你们上历史课的原因。”总统说，“不过现在是时候了……’

　　主任紧张地看着总统，他想起了一些离奇的谣言：总统书房的保险箱里藏着一些已经被禁止的古老书籍，圣经还是诗？只有弗德知晓！

　　穆斯塔法·孟德感受到了主任的焦虑，嘴角冷冷一笑。

　　“没问题的，主任，”总统的话里带着轻微嘲讽的色彩，“我可不会把他们腐蚀了。”

　　主任又困惑又惶恐。

　　如果觉得自己被人排挤轻蔑，那么自己也会表现出鄙视别人的样子。贝尔纳·马克斯露出轻蔑的笑容，每根毛发都看得相当清楚！

　　“看来我确实应该去看看。”亨利·福斯特说。

　　穆斯塔法·孟德身子往前一倾，伸出一根指头晃了晃，“试着想象一下，想象自己有一个‘妈妈’是什么感觉。”

　　又是那个粗俗的字眼，不过这回学生中可没人开口笑了。

　　“想象一下‘一家人共同生活’意味着什么。”

　　他们努力地想着，可脑袋一片空白。

　　“有任何人知道‘家’是什么意思吗？”

　　摇头。

　　坐着电梯，列宁娜·克朗从暗红色的房间来到了十七层楼，电梯出来往右拐，沿着长廊一直走，就来到了女更衣室。她打开门，钻进了一片嘈杂中，满眼都是女性的胳膊、胸脯和内衣。一百个浴缸里，热水倾泻而入，从小管子里汩汩地流出。轰轰——嘶嘶——八十个真空振动按摩仪器正同时为八十位年轻的女性保养着她们故意晒黑的曼妙躯体。背景的喧闹让每个人都必须扯着嗓子说话。合成音响里微微发颤地放送着超级短号的独奏。

　　“你好，法妮。”列宁娜对身旁的年轻女性打招呼道。

　　法妮在换瓶室工作，她也姓克朗，不过因为这地球上的二十亿人只有一万个姓，所以也不算是真正的巧合。

　　列宁娜拉下了外套前面及裤子两侧的拉链，脱下内衣，穿着鞋袜往浴室走去。

　　家——几个狭窄的房间，一个男人、一个定期怀孕的女人和一群什么年纪都有的孩子。没有新鲜空气、没有空间，就像那种未经消毒的监狱，充满了黑暗、疾病及难闻的味道。

　　（人群中最敏感的男孩听到总统这番极富感染力的描述后，脸色立马变得煞白，几乎要吐了出来。）

　　列宁娜走出浴室，擦干身体，拿起旁边一根连着墙壁的软管，对准了自己，好像自杀似地扣动了扳机——一阵混杂着爽身粉的热气从管口喷出。浴缸上面有喷洒香水的小龙头，包括古龙水在内，一共有八种不同的香水可供选择。她选择了左边第三个的西普香水，然后就拿着鞋袜往按摩仪器那边走去了。

　　家是一个物质和精神上都一样肮脏的地方。精神上是个兔子洞，是垃圾堆，极端拥挤，充斥着感情与臭气。让人窒息的亲密！危险、疯狂又见不得人的关系！母亲像母猫一样紧紧地搂住孩子，差别只在这猫会说话，不停地叫着：“我的宝贝儿，我的宝贝儿”，一遍又一遍。“我的宝贝，噢，在我的胸口，他的小手，他饿了，难受了，他不会表达。最后，宝贝睡着了，嘴边还挂着可爱的牛奶泡泡。我的小宝贝终于睡着了……”

　　“是，”穆斯塔法·孟德点头道，“简直是不寒而栗！”

　　按摩完，列宁娜像身体里面藏了颗珍珠，整个人散发着粉红色的光芒。她问法妮：“今天晚上你要跟谁出去？”

　　“没人。”

　　列宁娜惊讶地抬起了眉头。

　　“最近，我一直觉得不太舒服，威迩仕医生让我吃一点代妊娠素。”

　　“可是，亲爱的，你才十九岁，二十一岁前是不会强迫服用的。”

　　“我知道，亲爱的。但有的人早点使用会更好。威迩仕医生说，像我这种大骨盆的棕色女性，在十七岁时就应该开始服用了。所以我非但不是早了两年，反而晚了两年呢。”法妮打开了储物柜，指着上排架子上一排小盒子和带标签的瓶子。

　　列宁娜大声地读出了标签上的名字。“妊娠素精糖浆。卵巢素，质保期：弗德纪元六三二年八月前使用。乳腺精，饭前加少许水服用，一日三次。胎盘素，使用方式：静脉注射；用量：五毫升；使用频率：三日一次……呃！”列宁娜打了个寒战。“真不喜欢静脉注射。你呢，法妮，难道你不讨厌吗？”

　　“我讨厌，可如果它们对人有好处……”法妮是个理性的姑娘。

　　我主弗德，由于一些不可说的原因，在谈及心理学范畴的问题时，他更愿意称呼自己为弗洛伊德。他是揭示家庭中种种骇人听闻的危险的第一人。这个世界满是父亲，即满是悲惨；满是母亲，即满是堕落（从性虐到贞操）；满是弟兄姊妹叔伯姑婶，也就满是疯狂和自杀。

　　“可是，在沿新几内亚海边的某些岛上，萨摩亚岛的野蛮人间……”

　　孩子们在木槿花间嬉戏打闹，热带地区的阳光像蜜糖一样洒在他们赤裸的身上。他们没有家，或者说那二十间用棕榈叶搭成的屋子哪间都是他们的家。在特洛布里安岛人的观念里，家是属于那些古老鬼魂的，没有半个活着的人听说过“父亲”是什么玩意儿。

　　“极端，”总统说道，“相遇了。极端是注定会相遇的。”

　　“威迩仕博士说服用三个月的代妊娠素能在未来三四年间给我的健康带来相当大的好处。”

　　“是的，希望如此。”列宁娜说，“但法妮，难道接下来的三个月里你都不打算……”

　　“哦，当然不，亲爱的，顶多一两个星期而已。晚上，我打算去俱乐部玩音乐桥牌。我想你要出去？”

　　列宁娜点了点头。

　　“跟谁？”

　　“跟亨利·福斯特。”

　　“又是他？”法妮月亮般的圆脸上挂着一种不认可的惊讶和痛苦的表情，“你是说你还在和亨利一块儿出去？”

　　母亲、父亲、兄弟、姐妹，但还有丈夫、妻子、情人。另外，还有一夫一妻制度和爱情故事。

　　“虽然你们可能根本不知道我在说什么，”穆斯塔法·孟德说。

　　他们摇摇头。

　　家庭、一夫一妻制度还有爱情等等这些都具有独占性，禁锢了所有的冲动和精力，导致他们只能在一条狭窄的通道里发泄。

　　“但每一个人都属于其他人。”他总结道，引用了睡眠学习里的名句。

　　学生们毫不犹豫地点头表示同意，这句话在黑暗里重复了六万两千次，早已融入他们的血液。所以不仅仅是同意，而且是不言自明、不容辩驳地同意。

　　“但是，”列宁娜争道，“我们在一起仅仅才四个月。”

　　“仅仅才四个月！我喜欢你这句话，”法妮指着列宁娜责问道，“四个月，只有亨利没有别人，是吗？”

　　列宁娜又气又羞，满脸通红，但眼睛和声音里仍然带着挑衅的意思，“对，没有别人，”她的声音变得有些粗鲁，“而我也不明白为什么应该有别人！”

　　“哦，她也不明白为什么应该有别人。”法妮重复道，看着列宁娜的左后方，好像那儿站着一个看不见的第三人似的。突然，法妮换了个语调，“认真的，你得小心了。一直跟同一个男人厮混。可太糟糕了。如果你今天是三十五、四十岁，这样做还不至于太伤风败俗。但你，列宁娜，在你这个年纪！真的，别再继续了。你比任何人都清楚主任是多么反对过热和长时间的相处。而你，四个月，只有亨利·福斯特一个人，完全没有别人！天哪，想想要是主任知道了得多么生气……”

　　“想象一下管子里的水，想象一下它们所承受的压力。”学生们听话地开始在大脑里幻想起来。“如果我们在水管上扎一个小洞，”总统继续说道，“会有一条水柱喷射出来！”

　　在水管上扎二十个洞，就会有二十个迷你喷泉。

　　“我的宝贝，我的宝贝……”

　　“妈妈！”疯狂是会传染的。

　　“我的小心肝，我唯一仅有的、珍贵的﹑心爱的宝贝……”

第6章 (2)


　　母亲、一夫一妻制度、爱情。水柱很高，带着发狂的泡沫，愤怒地撒着野。所有的冲动只有一个出口。我的爱，我的宝贝！如此看来，那些早期现代人的疯狂、邪恶与悲惨是注定了的。那个世界不允许轻易地获取，不允许生存的人们拥有理智、美德与快乐。因为母亲和情人，因为不愿意遵守的禁令（那个年代可没有条件设置中心），因为无穷尽的诱惑和孤独的忏悔，因为疾病和苦痛，因为所有的不确定和贫穷，造成他们不得不努力地去感受。一旦努力感受（更可怕的是，在孤独中努力感受，在无望的自我孤立中去努力感受），那么怎么可能稳定呢？

　　“当然不需要放弃，时不时地和别人来往一下就行了。他可也有别的女孩儿，难道不是吗？”

　　列宁娜点了点头。

　　“我就知道一定会有的。你得知道，亨利·福斯特是个体贴人，完美的绅士。他会考虑到主任的，别忘了主任是多么顽固……”

　　列宁娜点点头道：“今天下午，他还拍了我的屁股呢。”

　　“你看！”法妮很得意，“这就是主任支持的：最严格的社会传统。”

　　“稳定，稳定。没有社会的稳定，就没有文明。没有社会的稳定，就没有个人的稳定。”总统的声音像乐器中的小号，让人们纷纷觉得自己变得更加的高大与兴奋。

　　机器运行，运行，也必须永无止境地运行，停下来即死亡。十亿人挣扎在地球的坚硬外壳上。轮开始转动，一百五十年后，地球上就会有二十亿人口。如果停下所有的轮，一百五十个星期后仍然会有十亿人，十亿因为饥饿而死亡的人。

　　轮必须永不停歇，稳定，有序，有人看管。这些轮必须有人看守。看守者应该同轮轴上的轮一样稳定，此外还要具备理智、服从、坚韧及满足的美德。

　　哭泣：我的宝贝，我的母亲，我的唯一；唯一的爱在叹息：我的罪，我可怕的上帝；因痛苦而尖叫；因灼热而呓语，因衰老、贫穷而呜咽……这样的人如何看守轮的转动？如果做不到……那十亿男性和女性的尸体要如何埋葬或烧毁呢？

　　“毕竟，”法妮以劝诱的口吻说道，“和亨利以外的男人交往也并不是什么痛苦或讨厌的事，你确实应该更放纵一些……”

　　“稳定，”总统坚持道，“稳定，这是首要也是终极的需求。是稳定带来了今天我们拥有的一切。”

　　他伸出手，指了一圈：花园，条件设置中心的宏伟大楼，以及在灌木丛中嬉闹、草地上奔跑的没穿衣服的孩子们。

　　列宁娜摇摇头。“莫名其妙地，最近我没怎么想过放纵。有些时刻，人们会不愿意放纵。你发现过这一点吗，法妮？”

　　法妮点头表示她的同情和理解，“就算是这样，也得努力。游戏得进行到底，毕竟，每一个人都是属于其他人的。”

　　“是的，每一个人都属于其他人。”列宁娜重复道，语速缓慢，然后叹了口气，沉默了一会儿。她抓住法妮的手，轻轻地压了一下，“你是对的，法妮。我要和往常一样努力。”

　　冲动的河流若遇阻挡，则必将洪水滔天。奔腾的水是感觉，是激情，还是疯狂，这取决于洪水的力量与大坝的坚强。如果河流能自在流淌，则必将温柔流往幸福的方向。胚胎如饥饿，代血浆泵将不停运转，速率八百次\/分钟，昼夜不停。换瓶的婴儿如嚎叫，护士就会拿来外分泌瓶。感觉悄悄地潜伏在欲望的产生与满足间。间隔一缩短，障碍就解除。

　　“孩子们！”总统说道，“我们不惜一切代价，只为了让你们成为没有情感的幸运儿。”

　　“我主弗德在他的小汽车里，”主任喃喃自语，“世界一片和谐。”

　　“列宁娜·克朗？”亨利·福斯特一边拉裤子拉链，一边跟助理主任交谈，“哦，她很吸引人，非常性感，真意外你居然没得到过她。”

　　“我也很意外。但我肯定能得到她的，只要给我一次机会。”

　　贝尔纳·马克斯在更衣室的走道对面，无意间听到上面的谈话，脸色苍白起来。

　　“老实说，”列宁娜说，“我的确已经开始觉得不新鲜了，每天都是亨利，太无聊了。”她拉起了左边的袜子。“嘿，你知道贝尔纳·马克斯吗？”列宁娜故作随意地问道。

　　法妮露出吃惊的神色：“难道你指的是……。”

　　“怎么了？他可是个阿尔法加，而且他还问我要不要一起去蛮族保留地看看。那地方我一直想去呢。”

　　“可是贝尔纳的名声？”

　　“我一定得在意那个吗？”

　　“我听说他讨厌玩障碍高尔夫。”

　　“听说，听说。”列宁娜嘲笑道。

　　“可他总是一个人，一个人。”法妮的语气里藏着几分害怕的意味。

　　“那么，和我在一起他就不是一个人了。另外，为什么大家要对他如此残忍？我倒挺喜欢他的，他很可爱。”列宁娜脸上泛起了笑容。贝尔纳在她面前常常露出羞涩的神情，多荒谬！好像她是世界总统，而他是最下等的伽玛减，负责看守机器而已。

　　“思考下你们自己的生活，”总统先生说，“有人遇到过无法解决的困难吗？”

　　沉默代替了回答。

　　“有谁体验过欲望长时间得不到满足？”

　　“呃。”一个孩子犹豫了，不知该不该开口。

　　“说，”主任说，“别让总统阁下等。”

　　“有次我想要个姑娘，最后等了快四个星期。”

　　“所以你应该感受到了一种强烈的感情吧？”

　　“强烈得可怕！”

　　“确实可怕！我们的祖先愚蠢又短视，当先驱们提出要消灭这些无谓的感情时，他们竟对这个提议不以为然。”

　　“只把她当块肉在评论。”贝尔纳咬牙切齿，“在这儿占有她，或是在那儿占有她。羊肉，她被贬低成了一块羊肉。她说她考虑考虑，她说这个星期能给我答复。啊，弗德，弗德，我的弗德！”他真想冲过去给那两个杂种几耳光。

　　“是的，我真心建议你试试看她。她非常美！”亨利·福斯特还在鼓励着。

　　“比如体外发育，普费茨纳和川口早就解决了所有的技术难题。可政府有把这当回事儿吗？没有。还有所谓‘基督教’这种东西，竟然强迫妇女去怀孕生孩子。”

　　“他太丑了！”法妮说。

　　“可我喜欢他的样子。”

　　“他还矮。”法妮做了个鬼脸；矮小可是低种姓的标志，可怕又典型的标志。

　　“我觉得小个头很可爱。叫人想爱抚他，你知道，像爱抚猫一样。”

　　法妮惊讶得不行了。“他们说当他还是个胚胎时，流水线上的工人搞错了，以为他是伽玛，往代血浆里加了乙醇，所以他才这么矮小。”

　　“这全都是没有意义的废话！”列宁娜愤怒了。

　　“英格兰曾经明令禁止过睡眠教学。当时有种所谓‘自由主义’的东西。议会，如果你们知道那玩意儿的话，曾经通过了一条禁止睡眠教学的法令。根据记录，当时有无数关于国民自由的演讲——做无能之人的自由，过悲惨生活的自由，与世界格格不入的自由。”

　　“小伙子，你很受欢迎。我向你保证，你很讨人喜欢。”亨利·福斯特拍了拍助理主任的肩膀。“毕竟，每一个人都是属于其他人的。”

　　一周三个晚上，这句话以这样的频率重复着，整整四年。睡眠学习法的专家贝尔纳·马克斯沉思着，六万二千四百次的重复所造就的真理。白痴！

　　“比如种姓制度，不断地提出，不断地否决。还有种所谓‘民主’的玩意儿，好像人与人之间不只是物理、化学上的平等。”

　　“够了。我只想说，我会接受他的邀请。”

　　贝尔纳痛恨他们，痛恨他们。但他们有两个人，身材高大，体格魁梧。

　　“九年战争始于弗德纪元一百四十一年。”

　　“即使他的代血浆里掺了酒精。”

　　“碳酰氯、三氯硝基甲烷、碘乙酸乙酯、二苯代胂氰、三氯甲基、氯甲酸酯、硫代氯乙烷……所有的化学武器都用上了，更不用说氢氰酸。”

　　“我根本不相信。”列宁娜做了结论。

　　“一万四千架飞机以散开的队形前进着，发出阵阵轰鸣声。但是在库达姆大街和第八区，炭疽炸弹的爆炸声就跟拍破一个纸袋发出的声响差不多。”

　　“因为我确实想去参观蛮族保留地。”

　　ch3c6h2（no2）3+hg（cno）2=呃，等于什么呢？地上的一个大窟窿，一堆破砖瓦，几片碎肉和黏液，一条穿靴子的腿，飞上天，“叭”的一下，落到血红的天竺葵丛里。那年的夏天简直是场精彩绝伦的表演。

　　“你完蛋了，列宁娜。不可救药，我放弃了。”

　　“俄罗斯在感染水源的供给方面有极其天才的技术。”

　　背对背，法妮和列宁娜的交流在一片寂静中继续着。

　　“九年战争和大萧条。世界的控制和毁灭，只能二选一。要么稳定，要么……”

　　“法妮·克朗也不错。”助理主任说。

　　在育婴室，阶级意识基础课已经上完，现在则是匹配未来的工业供应与需求的时间。“我的确喜欢坐飞机，”他们窃窃私语着，“我的确喜欢坐飞机。我的确喜欢穿新衣服，我的确喜欢……”

　　“虽然自由主义确实死在了炭疽杆菌的手上，但武力依然不是所有问题的灵丹妙药。”

　　“她没列宁娜丰满，一点儿也比不上。”

　　“但是旧衣服令人厌恶，”他们继续不知疲倦地低语着，“我们总是把旧衣服扔掉。扔掉比修补好，扔掉比修补好，扔掉比……”

　　“管理，是坐下来去领导，而不是暴力。要用头脑，用屁股去管理，绝非是拳头。例如，促进消费。”

　　“我已经准备好了。”列宁娜对法妮说道。但法妮仍然一言不发，垂头丧气地把身子倒向一边。“我们休战吧，亲爱的法妮。”

　　“为了工业利益，强迫每个男人、女人和孩子每年必须达到额定的消费。唯一的结果就是……”

　　“扔掉比修补好。修补越多，财富越少。修补越多……”

　　“总有一天，”法妮十分难过，‘你会有麻烦的”。

　　“良心上强烈的反对。零消费，回归自然。”

　　“我的确爱坐飞机，我的确爱坐飞机。”

　　“回到文化上。对，实际上是文化。如果老坐着读书，其余什么也不干，你的消费能高到哪儿去？”

　　“我看上去还好吗？”列宁娜问。她的衣服是深绿色的人造纤维丝，袖口和领子同样是绿色，不过材质是纤维胶毛皮。

　　“在高尔德斯草场，八百个职业军人死在机关枪下。”

　　“扔掉比修补好，扔掉比修补好。”

　　脱下了绿色的灯芯绒短裤和白色的纤维胶羊毛袜。

　　“后来是著名的大英博物馆大屠杀，用硫化二氯甲基消灭了两千名文化狂热者。”

　　一顶绿白相间的轻便鸭舌帽遮住了列宁娜的眼睛；她穿着翠绿色皮鞋，擦得锃亮锃亮的。

　　“最后，”穆斯塔法·孟德说，“总统们意识到使用武力毫无作用，于是便倒向了缓慢但是绝对有效的一些方法，比如体外发育、新巴甫洛夫条件设置法和睡眠学习法……”

　　在腰上，列宁娜戴上了一条镶银的绿色人造摩洛哥皮药囊带，“药囊带”上略微隆起的地方有避孕药，通过定时渗入身体来达到避孕的效果（列宁娜不是不孕女）。

　　“普费茨纳和川口的发现终于进入了应用阶段。于是，一场声势浩大的反怀孕的文化运动开始了……”

　　“太完美了！”法妮尖叫道，她喜欢列宁娜身上带着的那股魅力。“这条马尔萨斯带简直无懈可击！”

　　“同时掀起的，还有一场反传统的运动：博物馆被关闭了，历史建筑被摧毁了（大部分工作在九年战争期间就已经完成了）；所有弗德纪元一五零年以前出版的所有书籍全都被查封了。”

　　“我也得有像这样的一条带子。”法妮说。

　　“比如，那时还有所谓‘金字塔’的一种建筑。”

　　“我那条旧的黑带子……”

　　“有叫莎士比亚的人，当然，你们从来没听过。”

　　“太丢脸了——我的那条带子。”

　　“这就是纯正的科学教育的益处。”

　　“越缝越穷，越缝越……”

　　“我主弗德第一辆t型车出现那年……”

　　“这腰带用了快三个月了。”

　　“被定为******的元年。”

　　“扔掉比修补好；扔掉比修补好。”

　　“我以前说过，有个叫做基督教的东西。”

　　“扔掉比修补好。”

　　“是推崇低消费的伦理学和哲学……”

　　“我喜欢新衣服，我喜欢新衣服，我喜欢……”

　　“在低消费时代，基督教是不可或缺的，但是在机器和固氮的时代，基督教毫无疑问会是反社会的罪行。”

　　“亨利·福斯特送我的。”

　　“所以，所有的十字架变成了t字架。所谓‘上帝’，变成了弗德……”

　　“那是真正的代摩洛哥皮。”

　　“现在我们有了世界联邦。弗德日的庆典，社会的歌谣，以及团结一致。”

　　“弗德啊，我恨他们！”贝尔纳·马克斯思忖着。

　　“那时有个东西叫做天堂，但人们仍然大肆地饮酒。”

　　“只是肉，只是肉。”

　　“还有两种东西，一个是灵魂，另一个是永恒。”

　　“一定要问问亨利这带子是从哪儿弄来的。”

　　“那时使用的是吗啡和可卡因。”

　　“更糟的是，她把自己也只看做是肉而已。”

　　“弗德纪元一七八年，两千个药剂师和生化学家得到了资助。”

　　“他看上去确实不开心。”助理主任指着贝尔纳·马克斯说。

　　“六年后就量产了，商业化得很成功。你们知道，那完美的药。”

　　“我们来耍耍他……”

　　“精神欢愉，放松镇定，美好的幻象。”

　　“不开心，马克斯，不开心。”突然有人拍了他肩膀一下，贝尔纳吓了一大跳，抬头看去，是粗鲁的亨利·福斯特，“一克唆麻，能解决你的问题。”

　　“有基督教和酒精的一切好处，却没有它们的坏处。”

　　“弗德！我应该杀了他！”尽管贝尔纳心里充满了愤懑，但他依然只说了句，“不用，谢谢。”便推开了福斯特递过来的那管药片。

　　“只要个人觉得需要，便可以随时放假，不理会现实。回来的时候头疼和神话全都不翼而飞。”

　　“吃了它，”亨利·福斯特坚持着，“吃了它。”

　　“实际上就保证了稳定。”

　　“只需一小片，烦恼全不见。”助理主任引用了一句睡眠学习法里家喻户晓的格言。

　　“剩下来的唯一任务就是征服衰老。”

　　“滚蛋，滚蛋！”贝尔纳·马克斯大声吼道。

　　“哎呀，哎呀。”

　　“性激素，输血（需要年轻血液），镁盐……”

　　“记住，唆麻一吞，苦恼飞奔。”他们俩大笑着离开了更衣室。

　　“老年人身上的红斑全都不见了。当然，随之不见的还有……”

　　“别忘了向问马尔萨斯带的事。”

　　“精神上的怪癖。不过，性格没法改变，终身一样。”

　　“……在黄昏前打两局障碍高尔夫。我必须得坐飞机。”

　　“工作，游戏。六十岁时，我们的精力和品味还能和十七岁的人一样。在那个不幸的年代，衰老等于消极、退却、迷信，靠着读书和思考打发残年！”

　　“白痴，弱智！”贝尔纳·马克斯一边自言自语一边顺着走廊走向电梯。

　　“现在，一切都进步了。老年人依然可以工作、性交，没有时间、没有空闲，坐下来思考片刻的工夫都没有。即使由于这样那样的原因，不幸的有了那么一点点空闲的时间，交给唆麻吧。可口的唆麻，半克就是半个假日；一克就是一个周末；两克可以来个奇妙的东方之旅；三克便可在漆黑的月球上享受来世永恒。从唆麻假日里返回时，烦恼的事情已经无踪影，余下的是每天按部就班地工作和玩乐，像接力赛似的，一部感官剧接着另一部感官剧，一个丰满的姑娘接着另一个丰满的姑娘，一个电磁高尔夫球场到……”

　　“走开，小姑娘。”主任愤怒了，“走开，小家伙们！难道你们看不见总统阁下正在忙吗？去别的地方继续你们的性游戏。”

　　“随他们去吧。”总统说道。

　　缓慢地，威严地，伴随着机器运行的轻微声响，传送带继续前进着，速度三十三厘米\/小时。在红色的黑暗里，无数的红宝石正在散发微弱的光芒。

第7章 (1)


　　电梯里全是从阿尔法更衣室里出来的小伙子，列宁娜一进来就有不少人冲她点头微笑致意。她很受欢迎，几乎和电梯里所有人都发生过关系。

　　列宁娜也向他们打招呼回礼。都是可爱迷人的男性！不过，她仍然觉得乔治·艾泽尔的耳朵小点儿会更好（也许在传送带三百二十八米处时，工人多打了点儿甲状腺？）；看到本尼托·胡佛，不禁想到他脱掉衣服时的画面，身上的毛发太茂密了。

　　列宁娜转过身，眼睛因为想起了本尼托卷曲的黑色体毛而带了些悲伤的色彩。但是，在角落里，她看见了一个瘦弱又单薄的身体和贝尔纳·马克斯的忧郁面庞。

　　“贝尔纳！”她向他走去，“我刚刚正找你呢。”即使在电梯里，列宁娜的声音依然清脆动听。周围的人朝他们俩投了好奇的目光。“我想谈谈咱们去新墨西哥的计划。”从余光中，列宁娜瞥见了本尼托·胡佛惊讶的神情。那神情叫她心烦意乱，“他没想到我会再约他一块儿出去！”列宁娜在心里想着，然后她比往常都热情地大声地说道：“六月时，我想和你共度一个星期。”（总之，她在公开证明她并不仅仅只有亨利一个人。这下，法妮应该高兴了，即使对象是贝尔纳。）“对，”列宁娜对他露出了深情款款的微笑，“如果你还想要我。”

　　一朵红晕出现在贝尔纳过去苍白的脸上。“怎么脸红了？”她好奇，有些惊讶，但同时也明白这奇怪的反应是源于她的魅力。

　　“要不另外找个地方谈谈吧？”他结结巴巴地，看起来极为不自在。

　　“好像我说了什么过分的话似的，”列宁娜想道，“即使我跟他开个下流的玩笑，比如问他的妈妈是谁，他也不会比现在更心烦意乱的。”

　　“我想说，难道要在大家面前……”他脑子一片混乱，慌张得说不出话来。

　　列宁娜露出了坦诚又温和的笑容。“你真有趣！”她说；她也确实觉得他有趣。“至少提前一星期告诉我，好吗？”她换了一种语气，“我想我们应该会乘坐蓝色太平洋号火箭？从切林t字形塔楼起飞，是吗？还是从汉浦斯泰德起飞？”

　　在贝尔纳还没来得及开口之前，电梯停了。

　　“屋顶到了！”

　　电梯工长得像猴子，声音刺耳，个头很小，穿着黑色的束腰外套，半白痴伊普西龙减的标志。

　　“屋顶到了！”

　　他猛地打开大门，午后的温暖阳光让他吃了一惊，不由得眨了眨眼，“哦，屋顶到了！”他的语气里带着一种莫名的兴高采烈，好像从一片让人窒息的黑暗里突然快乐地苏醒过来，“屋顶到了。”

　　他冲着那些比他高出许多的客人们微笑，带着狗一样的崇拜表情。客人们说说笑笑地走出电梯，而电梯工一直目送他们离去。

　　“屋顶到了？”电梯工又说了一遍，不过这一次是问句。

　　电梯内一声铃响，天花板上的扩音器轻柔又威严地响起。

　　“下行，下行。十八楼。下行，下行。十八楼。下行……”

　　电梯工“砰”的一声关上门，按下按钮，电梯便又回到了一片狭窄的昏暗中，那才是他习惯到已经麻木的环境。

　　屋顶上温暖而明亮。夏日午后总是让人昏昏欲睡，尤其是加上过往的直升机“嗡嗡”的声音。上空五六英里处，火箭飞机加速飞过，发出更深沉的轰鸣，就像在抚摸温柔的空气。贝尔纳·马克斯深深地吸了口气，然后抬头看向天空，再看向四周蔚蓝的地平线，最后才把目光转到了列宁娜的脸上。

　　“真美！”他的声带颤抖着。

　　列宁娜对他投去了微笑，表情里有最深的同情和理解，“这个天气太适合玩障碍高尔夫，”她兴高采烈道，“现在我要飞了，贝尔纳。让亨利等太久他会发疯的。时间定好了记得通知我。”穿过平坦辽阔的屋顶，列宁娜挥着手走向了飞机库。贝尔纳依然留在原地，目光追随着她的白袜折射的光芒，捕捉着晒黑的膝盖走路时的活泼，观察着外套下合身的灯芯绒短裤柔软地起伏。他脸上逐渐露出了痛苦。

　　“不得不说她真漂亮。”一个洪亮又快活的声音说道。

　　贝尔纳吃惊得到处张望。本尼托·胡佛的大胖脸上堆满了笑容，真心诚意的笑容。本尼托脾气好，这是众所周知的。大家都说他可以一辈子不碰唆麻。一般人遇到那些倒霉事儿非得来个唆麻假日不可，而他从来都不介意，他的世界永远有明媚阳光。

　　“而且很丰满！可我不得不说，你啊，的确满脸的忧愁，你现在需要一克唆麻，”本尼托从裤子右边的荷包里掏出一个小药瓶，“只需一小片，烦恼全不见……嘿！”

　　没等他说完，贝尔纳已经转过身匆匆走掉了。

　　本尼托目不转睛地看着他的背影，思忖道：“这家伙究竟怎么了？”他茫然地摇了摇头，决定相信关于那个可怜鬼的传言——代血浆里掺进了酒精。“伤害了大脑，我看是。”

　　他收起了唆麻瓶，掏出了一包性激素口香糖，拿出一片，塞进嘴里，纳闷地向飞机库慢慢走去。

　　亨利·福斯特已经把他的飞机从库里推了出来，等列宁娜走进时，他已坐入了驾驶舱里。

　　“迟到了四分钟。”当她爬上飞机坐下来时，他只说了这么一句。亨利发动引擎，挂好档，直升飞机直冲上天。一加速，螺旋桨尖锐的轰鸣声从马蜂变成了黄蜂，又从黄蜂变成了蚊子。仪表片上显示他们的飞机正以每分钟两公里左右的速度上升。伦敦突然变成了一座缩微模型。才几秒钟时间，巨大的顶楼停机坪变成一只蘑菇，在公园和花园的绿野间拔地而起。旁边还有一株个头苗条点儿的长型蘑菇，它的头部是发光的混凝土圆盘，那就是切林t字形塔楼。

　　就像神话中大力士的躯干，几朵巨大的白云飘浮在他们上方，游荡在蔚蓝色的天空里。突然，一只鲜艳的红色小虫落在了其中一位巨人的肩膀上，嗡嗡地鸣叫着。

　　“那是红色火箭，”亨利说，“刚从纽约飞来。”他看看表，“延误了七分钟，”他摇了摇头，“这些大西洋航班——一点也不准时，太可耻了。”

　　他轻轻地抬起了脚，松开飞机加速器，头顶螺旋桨的轰鸣声又重新变成黄蜂、马蜂，然后是蜜蜂、金龟子、鹿角甲虫。飞机放缓了向上爬行的速度，过了会儿他们便悬浮在了空中，一动不动。亨利推了根杆，“咔嚓”一声，面前的螺旋桨开始旋转起来。由慢到快，而后越来越快，在眼前形成了一种圆形的光晕。水平方向上的风变得猛烈，声音也刺耳起来，这时他们前面的螺旋桨开始旋转起来。迎面而来的水平风吹得嗖嗖作响。亨利聚精会神地盯着仪表盘，当指针到达1200，便重新打开了头顶的螺旋桨。前冲力已经足够维持飞机继续在地球上飞行。

　　列宁娜低头，目光穿过双腿间的缝隙。从飞机底盘的窗户看下去，他们正飞行在公园区上方，公园区有六英里长，隔离了伦敦的中心城区和卫星城。绿地上仿佛爬满了密密麻麻的蛆虫。无数的调皮狗离心游戏塔组成了一座新的森林，穿插在树丛间闪着微光。在牧羊人森林旁边，两千对贝塔减的混双选手正在进行黎曼曲面网球赛。诺丁山-维尔施登的主干道两旁是五号自动扶梯球场。依林运动场上德尔塔们正在表演体操和集体歌曲。

　　“卡其色是多么丑陋的一种颜色啊。”列宁娜说，显然，睡眠教学在她身上很成功，她一直对自己的高种姓有优越感。

　　杭斯洛感官片摄制厂占地七公顷半。制片厂旁边有一队劳工正忙着为西大道重新铺设路面，他们穿着黑色和卡其色的制服，辛勤地工作。列宁娜和亨利飞过时，一个移动坩埚正好打开，流出了炽热滚烫的玻璃熔浆，发出刺眼的光芒。石棉压路机来来去去，绝缘洒水车开过的路上蒸腾起一片白茫茫的水雾。

　　在不伦特福德，电视机工厂俨然是座小镇。

　　“现在准是换班时间。”列宁娜说。

　　就像蚜虫和蚂蚁一样，身穿叶绿色制服的伽玛姑娘和黑色制服的半白痴们互相推挤着，有些在门口，有些则站在队伍中准备坐上单轨电车。紫红色制服的贝塔减在人群中走来走去。顶楼上直升机停停走走，一片生机勃勃的景象。

　　“说心里话，”列宁娜转头对亨利说，“幸好我不是个伽玛。”

　　十分钟后，他们来到了斯托克伯吉斯，开始了今天第一局障碍高尔夫。

　　贝尔纳急匆匆地走着，眼睛望着地上，不小心瞄到了人，便马上悄无声息地躲开。他好像正被敌人追捕，但他不想见到那些敌人的样子，唯恐他们比自己预想的更可怕。而他本人，则陷入一种深深的内疚和孤独中，无法自拔。

　　“可怕的本尼托·胡佛！”虽然那人的用心是好的，但只会把事情变得更糟。居心良好的人和居心不良的人做得一模一样。另外，列宁娜也让他备受煎熬。他还记得，在那几个星期里，他是多么希望能鼓起勇气问问她的决定，但是他不敢面对被拒绝的可能。那可是羞辱！假如她能同意，他又会多么的欣喜若狂啊！现在，虽然她已经明确表了态，可他却仍然不开心——列宁娜居然认为那个下午最适合用来打障碍高尔夫，还匆匆地跑去找亨利·福斯特。而且她应该会觉得他可笑，因为他不愿在公开场合谈论他们俩人最私密的事情。总之，他不开心，因为她和任何一个健康、有道德的正常英格兰姑娘一样，那么平庸，毫无与众不同之处。

第8章 (2)


　　他打开自己的机库仓门，叫来一对正在闲逛的德尔塔减，让他俩把飞机推到屋顶上。这两个飞机库工人来自同一个波卡胚胎组，个头一样矮，皮肤一样黑，面容一样丑。贝尔纳用一种相当尖锐、傲慢甚至带有攻击性的语气发出指令，就像对自身的优越感不太有把握的人常常所做的那样。对贝尔纳来说，跟低种姓的家伙们打交道是一件非常痛苦的事。因为他的身高比阿尔法的标准身高低了八厘米，身材瘦弱，整个体型反倒是跟一般的伽玛差不多。到底是为什么，这里面的原因就不得而知了（代血浆里误加酒精的流言极有可能是真实的，毕竟这世界是由意外所构成）。和低种姓的人交往时，贝尔纳总是想起自己的身体缺陷。“我是我，可我却希望不是我。”强烈的自我意识压得他喘不过气来。每一次，当他发现自己是平视，而非低头看着一个德尔塔的脸时，他便禁不住感到备受侮辱。那家伙是以应有的尊重对待我吗？他对别的阿尔法也是这种态度吗？类似的问题日夜笼罩着他，让他辗转反侧。但这并非毫无道理的庸人自扰。因为低种姓的家伙们经过条件设置和睡眠学习，总是把社会地位与个子大小联系起来。事实上，正是由于睡眠教学里重复了无数次的真理，人们普遍更喜欢高个儿。所以他的矮让他追求的女人嘲笑他，和地位相同的男人看不起他。这些嘲笑使他觉得自己与他们格格不入。他是个局外人。既然以局外人自居，他的行为举止也愈发地与众不同起来。但这些不合群的动作反而让大家对他的偏见更加深了，他感受到了更多的轻视和敌意。这样一来，局外感和孤独感便愈发的深化。对于被轻蔑，他逐渐产生了一种惯性的害怕，于是他变得总是愿意回避他的同辈，处理下属的事情时愿意带上过分刻意的自尊。他对亨利·福斯特和本尼托·胡佛那些人充满了苦涩的妒忌。他们不需刻意用音量证明自己的尊严，和往常一样说话就可以让一个伊普西龙执行他们的命令；他们心安理得地享受着优越的地位，在种姓制度里如此如鱼得水，自在无比。他们不去思考自我的位置，也完全忽略了自己环境的优越和舒适。

　　贝尔纳仿佛觉得那两个德尔塔减随从在推行飞机的时候有些不情愿，态度懒散。

　　“快！”贝尔纳急躁起来。随从中有人瞥了他一眼。从那双空洞的灰白色眼眸里，他感受到了一种野兽般的蔑视。“快！”他吼得更大声了，声音丑陋又刺耳。

　　终于，他爬上了飞机。一分钟，他便整装待发，向南边的河流那儿飞去。

　　好几个宣传局和情绪工程学院都位于舰队大街的六十层大楼里。地下室和最下面几层用于伦敦三大报的办公和印刷——《准点播报》（供高种姓人群阅读的报纸）、浅绿色的《伽玛报》及百分百单音节的卡其色《德尔塔镜报》。继续往上走，则分别是电视宣传局、感官片管理局和合成声与音乐局——一共占了二十二层。它们的上头是一些实验室和软垫房，供音轨作家和合成音乐作曲家创作精妙的乐曲。最上面的十八层则全部都是情绪工程学院的地盘。

　　贝尔纳降落在宣传大厦的楼顶。

　　“给下面的亥姆霍兹·沃森先生打个电话通知一下，”他命令门房的伽玛加，“就说贝尔纳·马克斯正在顶楼等候。”

　　他点了支烟，坐了下来。

　　电话打过去时，亥姆霍兹·沃森先生正在写作。

　　“跟他说我马上到。”他挂上了话筒，转身对秘书说，“这些东西就由你来收拾。”语气是一贯的公事公办，没有半点人情味。他对女秘书的灿烂微笑视而不见，站起身子，大步流星地走到了门边。

　　他是一个有力量的男人，胸膛厚实，肩膀宽阔，身材魁梧，行动迅速，步履矫捷而轻盈。脖子是根圆木，结实地撑起轮廓美丽的头颅，深色卷发，棱角分明，英俊非凡。正如他秘书乐此不疲重复的名言：每一公分都是个阿尔法加。他的职业是情绪工程学院写作系的讲师。在讲学的空当，他还是名情绪工程师。另外，他定期为《准点播报》撰稿，写感官剧剧本，而且精通口号和睡眠教学的技巧。

　　“能干，”这是他上司们的评价，“也许，（这时他们会摇摇头，意味深长地压低了嗓门）过分能干了点。”

　　的确，过分能干了点，他们没有错。智力上的超常给亥姆霍兹·沃森带来的后果和贝尔纳生理缺陷带来的后果很有些类似。身材矮小瘦弱让贝尔纳不愿和同伴们待在一起。这种关系上的疏远，不论从哪条现行的标准来看，都是心灵的负担，而这种负担更加剧了疏远。让亥姆霍兹意识到自己与众不同且十分孤独的，却是他出众的才干。两人都认同他们是孤独的个体。然而贝尔纳因为生理上的缺陷自始至终都在感受孤独，可亥姆霍兹·沃森的孤独却是最近的事儿，因为逐渐了解到自己的能干，他越来越明白他与周围的人完全不一样。这位自动扶梯壁球冠军，这位不知疲倦的情人（据说，不到四年，他就有过六百四十个不同的姑娘），这位可敬的委员，这位交际能手最近才突然明白：对他来说，游戏、女人、社交只能算是次等的好事。真正令他兴趣盎然的是另外一些事。到底是什么事呢？什么事呢？贝尔纳此行的目的正是跟他讨论这个问题。不过，鉴于亥姆霍兹总是滔滔不绝地发表他的意见，所以我们可以说，贝尔纳只是来再次听听他朋友的谈话。

　　亥姆霍兹刚踏出电梯，便被合成声宣传局的三个迷人姑娘给拦住了。

　　“哦，亥姆霍兹，亲爱的，今天晚上在埃克斯穆尔高地公园，我们一起野餐。”她们哀求道。

　　他摇摇头，从包围圈中费力地挤了出来。“不行，不行。”

　　“我们没邀请别的男人，只有你。”

　　面对如此美妙的承诺，亥姆霍兹依然无动于衷。“不行，”他重复道，“我很忙。”话一说完，他便头也不回地走掉了。可姑娘们依旧不肯放弃，一直跟在他身后，直到他上了贝尔纳的飞机，最后“砰“的一声关上门，热情的女人们才放弃了追逐。不过，她们也并非对此没有怨言。

　　“这些女人！”飞机升上天空，亥姆霍兹摇了摇头，“这些女人！”“是呀，太可怕了！”贝尔纳附和着他的话，假惺惺地表示同意，其实自己恨不得像亥姆霍兹那样拥有那么多的姑娘和那么少的烦恼。他突然感受到一种强烈的自吹自擂的需要，“我要带列宁娜到新墨西哥州去。”他竭尽全力装出一副无所谓的样子。

　　“是吗？”亥姆霍兹对此毫无兴趣。沉默了片刻，他又继续说道，“这一两个星期，我推掉了所有的委员会会议，谢绝了所有的姑娘。这在学院里可引起了轩然大波，你根本无法想象那混乱的局面。不过，还是挺值得的。其结果是……”他犹豫了一下，“总之，他们很古怪，古怪。”

　　生理上的缺陷可能导致心理上的负担，但这过程似乎是可逆的。过重的心理负担可以导致自我孤立，看不见听不到，拒绝外界的一切信息，生理上的欲望也被人为地消灭了。

　　旅程里余下的时间是在沉默中度过的。不过，当他们到达了贝尔纳的房间，在松软的气垫沙发上自在地躺下来之后，亥姆霍兹又开始了谈话。

　　他的语速很慢。“你是否曾经感觉到，身体里有种不知名的东西一直在等机会宣泄。某种你一直未曾使用的精力，就好像水都往下流成了瀑布，而不是形成漩涡。”他脸上充满了疑问。

　　“你是说，不一样的状况下人们会感受到不同的情绪吗？”

　　亥姆霍兹摇了摇头。“不完全是。我指的是，一种奇怪的感觉，有一些重要的话要说，也有力量去说，但我不知道要说什么，也不知道如何利用那股力量。如果有另一种写作的方式，或者能写一些其他的事情……”他沉默了一会儿，继续道：“你看，在说话方面，我是相当厉害的。我知道哪些话能让你突然间激动地蹦起来，像被针扎了一样。这些话听上去如此新颖，如此令人兴奋，虽然它们的实质不过是睡眠学习里重复了一万遍的道理。可是这样还不够。辞藻华丽是不够的，内容才是最重要的。”

　　“可是你话语里的内容都是好的，亥姆霍兹。”

　　“在它们行得通的时候，确实都是好的。”亥姆霍兹耸了耸肩，“可我的话不大行得通，在某种程度上它们甚至并不重要。我相信我可以做一些更重要的事情。是的，一些我认为会更迫切的事情。可究竟是什么呢？更重要的事究竟是什么？如果写的都是别人要求的东西，你怎么可能感受到迫切？语言像x光，如果使用得当，便能穿透一切，一读就觉得洞悉了你的心。那是我努力教给学生的东西之一：如何让文字拥有匕首一般的力量。可是把一篇论《本分歌》或是芳香乐器最新发展的文章写得穿透有力又如何？而且，在写那些东西的时候，你真的能够入木三分吗？真的能够像最强劲的x射线吗？没有意义的东西难道你能写出意义来吗？这就是我想说的。我一再努力……”

　　“嘘！小声点！”贝尔纳忽然伸出一根指头警告；二人听了听，“我觉得门口有人。”他低声说。

　　亥姆霍兹踮起脚尖，轻轻地穿过房间，突然打开了打门。没有任何人，当然没有。

　　“对不起，”贝尔纳觉得自己是傻瓜，尴尬极了，“我太紧张了，大概是这样。你知道的，当别人怀疑你，你也就开始怀疑别人了。”

　　贝尔纳擦了擦眼睛，叹了一口气，辩护的声音带着些伤感：“如果你知道我最近遭遇到的那些倒霉事就好了。”他的眼泪几乎都快流了出来，对自我的怜悯好像突然间一涌而出的泉水，“你要是知道就好了！”

　　亥姆霍兹·沃森感到一种莫名的不安。“可怜的贝尔纳！”他自语道。不过，同时他也在为这个朋友感到羞愧。他希望贝尔纳能拿出更多的尊严。

第9章 (1)


　　晚上八点，天黑了。斯托克波吉俱乐部大楼高塔上的扩音喇叭宣布又到了高尔夫球场的关门时间，那机器的声音简直比男高音还要美妙。列宁娜和亨利结束了游戏，一起朝俱乐部走去。托拉斯内外分泌中心的牧场上传来数千头牛的叫声，它们的荷尔蒙和奶一直作为原材料供应给伐恩汉皇家森林外的大工厂。

　　直升飞机的“嗡嗡”声填充了暮光里的每一道空隙。每隔两分半钟，铃声和气笛声便会响起，昭示着单轨轻轨列车的离开。这种列车是低种姓高尔夫球爱好者们唯一的交通工具，连接了球场与都市。

　　列宁娜和亨利坐上了飞机，在八百米处，亨利放慢了直升机螺旋桨的旋转速度，在逐渐模糊的景色里盘旋了一两分钟。贝恩汉沙滩的森林好像一片广袤的黑色水域，与西方明亮的海岸线融为一体。一道深红色的地平线预示着落日的最后一抹余晖也褪去了它的颜色。往上，天空是调色板，呈现着橘红到黄到水绿的渐变。往北越过森林，内外分泌工厂整栋大楼灯火通明，电的光辉和力量轻而易举地穿透了窗户。旁边的高尔夫球俱乐部大楼比工厂矮得多，那只是低种姓的营房。一道隔离墙为阿尔法和贝塔们划出了他们的小宿舍。通向单轨火车站台的路上仿佛有蚂蚁迁徙的队伍，黑压压的一片。仔细一看，那是低种姓的人们你推我搡地赶往站台。从玻璃拱门里，一列亮着灯的火车驶入了旷野。目光随着火车一直东行，穿过了暗黑的平原，停在了泥沼火葬场的宏伟建筑上。为了照顾夜间飞行的飞机安全，几束泛光灯打亮了四座高耸入云的烟囱，烟囱顶上还附带着暗红色的危险标志。这是一个路标。

　　“烟囱口那里阳台似的玩意儿是什么？”列宁娜询问道。

　　“磷回收，”亨利简洁地解释道，“火化后产生的气体通过烟囱排向天空。在气体上升的过程中，将有四道不同的工序对其进行处理。以前，人体火化的过程中，p2o5（五氧化二磷）会全部流失，而现在，百分之九十八都能被收集起来再次利用。一个成年人可以提供一千五百克以上的五氧化二磷。英格兰每年消费的四百吨磷中绝大部分都来自这一途径。”亨利的脸上有种快乐的骄傲感，他是打心眼儿里为这项成就感到自豪，就好像那是由他亲手创造的一样。“想想在我们死了之后，还能对社会有益，这是多么值得高兴的事情！我们的尸体能帮助植物生长。”

　　此时，列宁娜已经把目光转向了别的地方，她俯瞰着正下方的单轨火车站。“我完全同意。但在帮助植物生长的方面，阿尔法和贝塔们并不能比恶心的低种姓们，比如伽玛、德尔塔、伊普西龙，发挥更大的力量。这难道不是件奇怪的事儿吗？”

　　“从理化的角度来看，人是平等的。而且，即使是伊普西龙也是社会不可或缺的部分。”

　　“即使是伊普西龙……”听到这些话语，突然间，一幕回忆浮现在了列宁娜的脑海中。那时她还很小，还是上学的年纪。一天夜里，她不知怎么地醒了过来，第一次，她发现了每次入睡后缠绕着她的喃喃细语。飞机上的列宁娜仿佛又一次地看到了那晚的月光，那一长排小小的白色的床；她又听到了那个温柔的声音，那声音说道：“每个人都为别人服务。我们离不开每一个人，即使伊普西龙也是有用的，我们离不开伊普西龙。每个人都为别人服务，我们离不开任何人……”（在无数的夜晚里这些话语被无数次地重复，遗忘它们成了不可能的任务。）列宁娜忆起了当时她的害怕和惊讶，她是第一次体验到这些陌生的感觉；当时，她思考了半个小时，然后在这些无止境重复的话语的影响下，她的心灵又渐渐地得到了安慰，平静了下来，困意也又一次偷偷地向她袭去。

　　“我想伊普西龙们并不在意他们自己是不是伊普西龙。”她大声说道。

　　“这是当然的，他们不可能在乎。他们压根不知道做其他种姓人的感觉。但是我们在乎，因为我们有不同的条件设置，有不同的社会参数。另外，我们也有着不同的遗传。”

　　“真高兴我不是个伊普西龙。”

　　“可如果你是，你的条件设置也会让你为自己不是个贝塔、阿尔法而感激万分的。”亨利挂上了档，直升飞机向前冲去，飞往伦敦的方向。在他们身后，西方的暗红色和橙色几乎已经暗到看不见了，一大片乌云爬上了天空。当他们经过火葬场时，飞机被烟囱里冒出的热气托了起来，直到后来遇上了一团冷气流，才又降了回去。

　　“喔！在天空里上上下下，这感觉真棒！”列宁娜很开心。

　　但一时间，亨利的声音里有种类似忧伤的感情。“你知道这代表什么吗？有一个人永远地消失了，他化作了一股热气，升上天空。那是一个怎么样的人呢？男人还是女人，是个阿尔法还是个伊普西龙……”他叹了口气，然后声音变得愉悦而坚定，“无论如何，有一件事我们是确定的：不管他曾经是谁，在他活在这世上的时候，他很快乐很幸福。因为在现在这个时代，每一个人都又快乐又幸福。”

　　“是的，每个人都很幸福。”列宁娜附和着。曾经每天晚上，他们都在睡眠学习里听着这些话，不断地重复重复，一百五十遍，一共十二年。

　　他们停在了亨利公寓楼的顶楼，这栋四十层的大楼位于威斯敏斯特大教堂。下了飞机，他们走进电梯，直接前往餐厅。在那儿，两人同一群喧闹开心的伙伴共度了美妙的晚餐时光。咖啡时间，唆麻是饭后甜点。列宁娜来了两颗半，亨利吃了三颗。九点二十，两人走到了街道另一边的威斯敏斯特大教堂歌舞餐厅，全新开张。天空里没什么云，月亮也藏匿起来，只有星星寥落地点缀着夜幕，但两人完全没意识到这幕冷清的景象。高空广告牌电力十足，光彩夺目，掩盖了天空的暗淡。“加尔文·司徒普和他的十六位萨克斯风手。”威斯敏斯特大教堂新的大门上，几个巨大的字邀请着每个路过的陌生人。“伦敦最佳色香乐队演奏——最新合成音乐”。

　　他们走了进去，空气里充溢着龙涎香和檀香的独特味道，让人觉得又热又闷，心浮气躁。大厅的天花板是球面的，色调转换器在那儿投射出了一幅热带地区落日的风景。十六位萨克斯风手正在演奏过去的一首经典歌曲：“没有瓶子比得上你，可爱的小瓶子，我最亲爱的。”在打过蜡的光滑地板上，四百对人正翩翩起舞。列宁娜和亨利走进了舞池，成了里面的第四百零一对。萨克斯风的呜咽像是月光下的小猫咪在对叫，男高音的吟唱则像是正在经历一场小小的死亡。这美妙的和声层次分明，颤抖的声音向上爬升，到达高潮，越来越高，越来越高——终于，随着指挥的一挥手，释放了这飘飘仙乐的最后一个破碎的音符，十六名乐手呆若木鸡般灵魂出窍。降a大调石破天惊，接着是一片宁静与黑暗，减弱的乐声在寂静与黑暗中以四分之一音的梯级逐渐下滑，下滑为如耳语般轻柔的主和弦。那和弦久久萦绕（背景音是四五拍子的旋律），把强烈的企盼寄托在了昏沉中的每一秒钟。最终，企盼实现了，突然勾画出旭日东升的场面，十六个声音齐声高唱：

　　“我的瓶子，我永远需要你！

　　我的瓶子，为何我得换瓶出世？

　　在你的庇护下，天色蔚蓝，

　　在你的身畔，四季如春般温暖；

　　因为，

　　没有瓶子比得上你，

　　可爱的小瓶子，

　　我最亲爱的。”

　　一圈，一圈，又一圈。列宁娜和亨利在舞池里同他人一样的旋转，在威斯敏斯特大教堂里跳着五步圆舞曲，同时在另外一个世界里他们也在进行着美妙的舞步——唆麻假日世界，一个温暖、华丽又无限友好的世界。那个世界里的每一个人都内心无比善良，外貌无比优异，心情无比舒畅安详，每一个人！“我的瓶子，我永远需要你……”列宁娜和亨利已经拥有了他们需要的……他们在瓶子里，此刻，他们正安稳地待在里头，天气温暖如春，天空永远蔚蓝。但十六个乐手精疲力竭地放下萨克斯风后，音响里开始播放最新的马尔萨斯忧伤曲，他们俩变成了一对孪生胚胎，玻璃瓶里是一片代血浆的海洋，两人随着波涛轻柔地荡漾。

　　“晚安，亲爱的朋友们。晚安，亲爱的朋友们。”扩音器里响起了催促人们离场的号令，这号令却披着亲切悠扬的客套外衣。“晚安，亲爱的朋友们……”

　　众人一起离开了大楼。暗淡的天空里，星星，比起刚才，已经孤独地走了很长一段距离。尽管绝大部分高空广告牌都已经熄灭了，但丝毫也没有影响到两个年轻人的心情。他们依旧欢乐舒畅，忽略了夜晚的黑。

　　在舞会结束前的半小时，他们吞下了今天的第二剂唆麻。药效发挥，在现实世界和思维间筑起了一堵密不透风的墙壁。他们又回到了瓶子里，穿过了街道；在瓶子里，他们坐上了电梯，来到了二十八层楼的亨利的家。不过即便是在瓶子里，尽管列宁娜已经服用了两剂唆麻，她依然记得按规则做好所有的避孕措施，一条也没漏掉。多年的睡眠学习和训练了五年的马尔萨斯操，从十二岁到十七岁每周三次，让这些措施已经变成了肢体行为中天生的一部分，就像眨眼一样，不可回避也不可缺少。

　　“哦，这倒提醒了我，”从浴室出来的列宁娜说道，“法妮·克朗想知道，你送给我的那条可爱的绿色摩洛哥皮药剂带，到底是从哪儿弄到的。”

　　每隔半个月的礼拜四，贝尔纳都要参加团结礼拜日的活动。在爱神会堂（最近，按照第二条款的要求，亥姆霍兹经过选举成为了这儿的管理委员会的委员）早早吃过晚餐，贝尔纳与朋友们道过别，登上了屋顶，坐进了一架计程飞机里，前往弗德森社区歌厅。飞机爬升了几百米后，开始向东行驶，转弯时，那庄严又宏伟的singery大楼便映入了眼帘。泛光灯照亮了它的白色人造卡拉拉大理石外表，三百二十米的高度，为所在的鲁德山增加了一个永远不灭的白色光环。大楼楼顶的停机坪四角各有一个巨大的t字架，在夜色里闪耀着暗红色的光芒，二十四个镀金大喇叭正因神圣的合成乐曲隆隆作响。

第10章 (2)


　　“见鬼，迟到了。”贝尔纳一眼就瞧见了大亨利钟上的时刻。在他掏出钱付账的时候，钟声就敲响了。“福”，金色的喇叭吟唱出了低沉又洪亮的调子，“福，福，福……”到第九下才停下来。贝尔纳急忙朝电梯跑去。

　　大楼底层是这一次弗德庆祝日与群众歌会的礼堂。礼堂上面是团结小组每半个月举行仪式的地方，每层一百个房间，像这样的房间整栋大楼一共有七千个。贝尔纳乘坐电梯下到了第三十三层，快速地穿过走廊，来到了三二一零室前。他在门口迟疑了一会儿，为自己鼓了鼓劲，开门走了进去。

　　谢天谢弗德！他不是最后一个。房间里，十二张椅子围成一圈，还有三张是空的。于是，他偷偷地溜到了最近的椅子旁边，并打算对后来人皱眉头。要知道，迟到可不是好事！

　　他刚坐下，左边的姑娘便转过身问道：“今天下午，你玩的什么？障碍高尔夫还是电磁球？”

　　贝尔纳望了她一眼（天哪！是莫甘娜·罗斯柴尔德），红着脸承认道哪个也不是。莫甘娜惊讶极了，望着他，不知说些什么才好。于是，两人陷入一阵尴尬的沉默。

　　她赶紧又转过身，和左边那个更爱运动的小伙子寒暄起来。

　　“真是一个相当好的开始。”贝尔纳觉得自个儿很悲催，预感到这一回自我救赎的计划又失败了。如果刚才他不是匆匆忙忙地坐在这儿，而是先观察观察环境就好了！没准现在他的旁边就坐着菲菲·布莱德劳芙和乔安娜·迪塞尔了。可他却像瞎了眼似的让自己坐到了莫甘娜身旁。莫甘娜！我主弗德呀！瞧瞧她那两道黑眉毛！——或者，完全可以说是一道！因为它们可不像其他同类那样是分开的，即使是在鼻子上面，左右的眉毛仍然紧密地团结在一起。弗德！贝尔纳的右边是克莱拉·笛特汀。好吧，笛特汀倒是没有一字眉，可是她胖得已经有点过分了。菲菲和乔安娜倒是一切都刚刚好：凹凸有致的身形，一头美丽的金发，身高也恰如其分比他稍矮……而她俩中间，她俩中间坐的却是那个大笨蛋川口汤姆！

　　最后一位到场的组员萨落基尼·恩格斯姗姗来迟。

　　“你迟到了，希望这是最后一次。”组长严厉地批评道。

　　萨落基尼道了歉，溜到唯一空着的座位上，坐在了吉姆·波卡诺夫斯基和赫伯特·巴枯宁中间。人都到齐了，组成了一个毫无瑕疵的完美的团结圈。男，女，男……围绕着桌子，性别无穷地交替着。坐在一起的十二人共同等待着被融成一个统一的个体，为此他们愿意放弃自己独立的身份。

　　组长站起来，在胸前画了个t字，开启了合成音响，鼓点和乐器的合奏弥漫了整个房间，轻柔而舒缓。旋律不停地重复着，逃不开躲不掉。现在听到的，是团结圣诗第一章。一遍，一遍，又一遍，耳朵渐渐地失去了听觉，是腹部在感受着这激昂的节拍。圣诗里挥之不去的恸哭和尖叫，萦绕在，哦不，不是脑海，萦绕在每个人的恻隐之心中。

　　组长第二次在胸前画了道t字，然后坐了下来。仪式开始。中央的桌子上放着大无畏的唆麻药片，传递着的爱之杯里放着草莓唆麻冰激凌。它从一只手流动到了另一只，伴随它还有一句不停被重复的口号“为我的覆灭干杯”，一共响起了十二回。然后在管弦乐队的伴奏下，大家一起唱起了团结圣诗第一章：

　　“弗德啊，让我们十二人变成共同体，

　　就像流入社会之河的水滴，

　　啊，现在就把我们变成共同体，

　　如您的汽车一样驰骋于这天地。”

　　十二节圣诗唱完了，爱之杯第二次被传递。这一回，口号变成了“为更大的生命干杯”。每个人都干了杯。不知疲倦的音乐继续着，鼓点继续着，旋律里的恸哭和嚎叫继续着，萦绕在慈悲的心间。第二章团结圣诗开始了。

　　“来吧，更大的生命，社会的朋友，

　　十二人的牺牲只为你的成就。

　　我们期待死亡，因为我们的挥手，

　　将换来更大的生命世间存留。”

　　又是十二个小节。现在，唆麻开始发挥作用。眼神在闪耀，面颊变红润，大爱之光化作每个人脸上的友善笑容。连贝尔纳都觉得自己被眼前的气氛所感染了。当莫甘娜·罗斯柴尔德回头对他微笑的时候，他也全力以赴地以微笑回报。但是那眉毛，那可怕又可笑的连成一道的眉毛，一眼就能看到。贝尔纳做不到视而不见那眉毛，做不到，怎么努力也勉强不了。只能说，目前环境的感染作用对他是极为有限的。不过，如果他坐在了菲菲和乔安娜之间，也就……爱情之杯第三次传递。“为他的降临干杯。”莫甘娜·罗斯柴尔德欢欣鼓舞地说道。传杯仪式正好从她那开始。喝过唆麻，她将爱之杯传给了贝尔纳。“为他的降临干杯。”贝尔纳重复着她的话，虔诚万分地试图去感觉他的即将到来，但莫甘娜的那道眉毛仍然在他脑海里打转。对贝尔纳来说，他的降临还遥遥无期。他把杯子传给了笛特汀。“又要失败了，”他心想，“我就知道。”不过，他仍然竭尽全力地欢笑着。

　　又一轮传递的结束，组长举起了手，开始合唱团结圣诗第三章：

　　“感觉更大的生命如何降临！

　　欢乐吧，在欢乐里成为死亡的贵宾！

　　在音乐的鼓点里你我融合！

　　因为你是我，而我也是你！”

　　圣诗一节接着一节，声音开始颤抖，带着前所未有的激情。即将到来的降临就像天空里的电压。组长关上了音乐，最后一节的最后一个音符消失了，接下来是绝对的寂静——被伸展的期望在带电的生命里颤抖爬行。组长伸出了一只手；突然，突然出现了一个声音，一个浑厚强大的声音，它比所有人类的声音都要悦耳，都要丰富，都要温暖，都要富有爱与怜悯。这个美妙的、神秘的、超自然的声音出现在人们的头顶，它缓慢地说道，“哦，弗德，弗德，弗德。”声音渐渐地低了下来。对于每一个聆听者，一种奇异的温暖从心口涌现扩散至四肢的末端。他们热泪盈眶；他们的心脏，他们的肺腑好像拥有了独立的生命，在身体内部自由地移动。“弗德！”他们融化了，“弗德！”分解了，消失了。那个声音突然变了个调，像喇叭一样震惊。“听！听！”他们听着。停顿了一下，那声音又变成了低声的私语，可那私语却比最大声的哭号拥有更多打动人心的力量。“更大的生命的脚步，”它继续道，又重复了一遍，“更大的生命的脚步。”那私语几乎快听不见了。“它的脚步就在楼梯上”，又一次，绝对的寂静；暂时放松的期待又一次被拉紧了，越来越紧，越来越紧，几乎到了撕裂的边缘。更大的生命的脚步，他们听到了，他们听到了，轻柔地走下了台阶，走下了那看不见的台阶，离他们越来越近。他的脚步。突然间期待的断裂点到达了。瞪大了眼睛，张大了嘴巴，莫甘娜·罗斯柴尔德突然跳了起来。

　　“我听见他了，”她哭叫道，“我听见他了。”

　　“他来了。”萨落基尼·恩格斯尖叫道。

　　“是的，他来了，我听见了。”菲菲·布莱德劳芙和川口汤姆同时跳了起来。

　　“哦，哦，哦！”乔安娜激动得说不出话来。

　　“他来了！”吉姆·波卡诺夫斯基大声喊道。

　　组长往前一弯，按下按钮，室内顿时响起了铙钹和铜管的呓语，以及手鼔的急响。

　　“啊，他来了！”克莱拉·笛特汀尖叫道。“啊！”她的喉咙仿佛被什么东西割断了。

　　贝尔纳觉得自己也应该做点什么表示表示，连忙跳了起来，大声叫道：“我听见他来了，他来了。”可那不是真的，他什么也没听见。对贝尔纳来说，谁也没有来。没有人，尽管有音乐，尽管大家越来越激动。不过，虽然什么也没听到，但贝尔纳还是挥着他的胳膊，跟着大家一起欣喜地尖叫。当别人开始手舞足蹈的时候，他也加入了进来。

　　十二个人围成圈跳起舞来，每个人的手都搭在前边人的屁股上，一圈又一圈，齐声呼喊着，跟着音乐的节奏跺着脚，手也跟着前奏拍打着前边人的屁股；十二双手像一双手一样，虽然都拍打着前面的屁股，却只响起了一个声音。十二个人是一个人，十二个人是一个人。“我听到了，我听到他来了。”音乐加快了，脚下的舞步加快了，按节奏击打的手也加快了。突然，巨大的合成声音低沉地宣布救赎的降临和团结的实现，即将到来的十二合一，更伟大生命的代表。“狂欢吧！放纵吧！”那低音歌唱道，手鼔又一次敲起，奏出了激昂的节拍：

　　“狂欢吧放纵吧！弗德和欢乐，

　　亲亲姑娘们，把她们变成一个；

　　男男女女静静地拥抱着；

　　狂欢和放纵，解脱一切的坎坷。”

　　“狂欢吧放纵吧，”十二个人渐渐地和唱了起来，“弗德和快乐，亲亲姑娘们……”唱着唱着，灯光慢慢变暗了——暗了，同时变得更温暖、更丰润、更鲜红，最后变成了胚胎库里那种暗红的颜色。十二个人在这暗红的暮光里共舞。“狂欢吧放纵吧……”在血红的颜色和胚胎瓶似的昏暗里，他们继续转圈，继续舞蹈，继续敲打出永不疲倦的节拍。“狂欢吧放纵吧……”温柔地，那低沉的声音在浅唱在低语；在红色的暮光里好像出现了一只巨大的黑色鸽子仁慈地盘旋在正低头抬首的人群上空。

　　他们站在屋顶上；大亨利钟刚刚敲响了十一点的钟声。这个夜晚宁静而温暖。

　　“棒极了，不是吗？”菲菲·布莱德劳芙说。“真的棒极了，不是吗？”她兴高采烈地望着贝尔纳，可这欢乐里丝毫没有激动和兴奋的痕迹——因为兴奋意味着贪得无厌仍不满足。她有的是达到圆满之后那种平静的狂喜，她的宁静，绝非因为苍白而空洞的满足感，而是那种生活平衡、精力充沛、万事和谐时才能感受到的宁静状态。一种丰富而充满生机的宁静。因为团结祈祷式既是给予也是索取，拿掉是为了再填满。她变得更充实，更完美，不再仅仅是她自己。“你不觉得这一切都很棒吗？”她看着贝尔纳的脸，眼睛里闪烁着超越自然的光亮。

　　“当然，我认为这非常棒，”他撒了谎，把视线移开看向别处；看到她那张变形的脸对贝尔纳是一种指控，是在讽刺着他的异常。贝尔纳现在的孤独感和仪式开始前一些深，他的内心的空洞没有得到丝毫的填充。在别人融合成更伟大的生命的时候，他却置身事外，没有赎罪；即使在莫甘娜的怀抱里，他却感到比此生任何时刻都要多得多的无望的孤独。灯光从深红变回明亮时，他的自我意识已经强烈到让他觉得痛苦不堪。他很不幸，也许，也许这是他自己的错（她明亮的眼睛仿佛在指责他）。“棒极了，”他重复道，但他此时唯一能想到的却只有莫甘娜的眉毛。

第11章 (1)


　　“另类，另类，很是另类，”列宁娜是如此评价贝尔纳·马克斯的。“着实太另类了”，这使得她在之后的几个星期内不止一次考虑是否要改变跟他去墨西哥的计划，也许应该和本尼托·胡佛同前往北极。不过，她已然去过北极了，就在去年夏天跟乔治·埃泽去的，而且觉得那儿异常痛苦。整天无所事事，毫无新鲜趣味可言，旅馆又土得要命，卧房内既没有设电视，也没有芳香风琴，唯独有那恶心的合成音乐，二十五个自动扶梯壁球场要容纳两百多人。显然，她再也不想去北极了。话说回来，她也曾走马观花式地游过美国一程，不过未玩尽兴。她当时在纽约度过的那个周末简直毫无档次可言的，跟让·雅克·哈比布拉或跟波坎诺夫斯基·琼斯一起，具体是谁她已经想不起来了。不过，这点不重要。因此，再飞一趟西部，并足足地呆上一个星期的旅游计划，这倒是很吸引她。而且在此期间会安排至少三天在野蛮人（指印第安人）居留区度过。整个中心只有六七个人去过那儿，其中阿尔法加心理学家贝尔纳，就是少数具有批准资格的人之一。对列宁娜来说，这机会难得。也难得碰见如此另类的贝尔纳，所以她犹豫不决。其实她还真想过要不要顶风尝试一次，和那搞怪的老本尼托再去北极一次。至少本托尼还算正常，而贝尔纳却……

　　“代血浆里掺了酒精”，每当法妮认为别人的举动古怪时，她就会这么说。一天晚上，列宁娜和亨利一起过夜。睡觉前，她有些焦虑地说起了她那位新恋人，可怜的贝尔纳，不过亨利则认为这人简直是头犀牛。

　　“难道你能教会犀牛变戏法？”他精简有力地点评道，“连条件设置都不能正常反应的人，还真跟犀牛差不多，可怜的家伙！贝尔纳就是其中一个。如果不是他的业务做得还行，主任早就开除他了。不过，我觉得他还过得去。”他安慰性地加了一句。

　　也许是过得去，不过还是够令人发愁的。首先他有一个怪癖，就是总喜欢私下行动，说白了就是无所事事。私人活动有什么意思呢（上床除外，不过一个人总不能整天耗在床上吧）。实际还真没什么可干。他们俩第一次出去约会，那天下午天气明朗怡人，列宁娜想先去牛津联会吃饭，再去托开乡村俱乐部游泳，但是贝尔纳觉得人太多。于是列宁娜又提议去圣安德鲁打电磁高尔夫，但贝尔纳仍然不愿意，认为玩电磁高尔夫是浪费时间。列宁娜诧异地问道：“那你的时间是用来干吗的？”

　　当然是去湖边散个步。贝尔纳这么想也这么提议了：在苏崎岛上岸，然后去石楠林里转转。“只有你和我，只有我们，列宁娜。”

　　“可是我们整个晚上都将单独相处，贝尔纳。”

　　贝尔纳脸红了，望了望别处。“我是说，单独聊聊天。”他小声说。

　　“聊聊？有什么好聊的呢？”把一个美好的下午用来散步和聊天，是多么奇怪呀。

　　她最终说服了贝尔纳，虽然他还是极其不情愿。不过，他们还是一起飞到了阿姆斯特丹去看女子重量级摔跤比赛四分之一决赛。

　　“哪儿都是人，”他小声地埋怨道，“这和平常有什么两样？”整个下午他都闷闷不乐，不愿跟列宁娜的朋友们说话（在摔跤比赛期间，去唆麻冰激凌店时，他们遇见了一群列宁娜的朋友）。尽管他很不开心，却断然拒绝了列宁娜硬塞给他的半克树莓唆麻冰激凌。“我宁愿做我自己，”他说，“就算自己讨人嫌，也不想效仿他人的生活，即使他们很快乐。”

　　“及时一克唆麻，胜过平时九克。”列宁娜引用了睡眠教学中传授的宝贵智慧。

　　贝尔纳心里很不耐烦，推开了她递来的杯子。

　　“现在可别放任你那坏脾气，”她说，“记住，‘只需一小片，烦恼全不见’。”

　　“看在弗德的分上，别胡闹了。”他叫了出来。

　　“一克唆麻，好过烦恼。”列宁娜耸了耸肩膀，庄重地做了结论，吃光了所有冰激凌。

　　回程时，路过英吉利海峡，贝尔纳坚持要关掉推进器，靠直升机的螺旋桨盘旋于海浪上空一百英尺的地方。天气开始变糟，刮起了西南风，天空也愈发地阴郁。

　　“看外面。”他指示道。

　　“真可怕。”列宁娜从窗口缩了回来。她很害怕，害怕夜色中飞驰的空虚，害怕身下汹涌的黑浪，害怕乌云里时隐时现的苍白的月亮。这一切都令人毛骨悚然。“把收音机打开！快点儿！”她伸出手去找仪表盘上的旋钮，随即拧开。

　　“……你心中的天空如此蔚蓝，”十六个震颤的假音，“万里无……”

　　那声音像打了个嗝，停了下来——贝尔纳把电源关了。

　　“我想安静地观海，”他说，“那种繁杂的噪音会抹灭人看海的心情。”

　　“我觉得这音乐很好听，而且我没兴趣看海。”

　　“但我想看，”他坚持地说，“海让我感觉……”他稍作犹豫，“寻思着用什么话语来表达自己的意思，“更像我自己了，如果你能听懂的话。就好像自己能够决定自己，而非完全从属于别人，不仅仅是社会集体的一个细胞。你也会这么想吗，列宁娜？”

　　列宁娜却惊叫了起来。“太可怕了，太可怕了！不愿意做社会中的一员？你居然说出了这样的话。每一个人都应该为别人服务，因为没有别人我们就会一事无成。就连伊普西龙……”

　　“对，我知道。”贝尔纳不无嘲讽地说，“‘就连伊普西龙也可以利用\"，我也可以利用。他妈的，我真恨不得自己是没有用处的废物！”

　　他言辞中流露出的亵渎意味让列宁娜震惊极了。“贝尔纳！”她用惊诧且痛苦的声调抗议道，“你怎么能这样说？”

　　“我为什么不能这样说？”他沉思了片刻，换了一种语调说，“不，主要的问题是在于：我为什么不能讲？或者这么说吧——我清楚地知道我为什么不能讲——如果我能讲会怎么样呢？如果我是自由的，不为条件设置所奴役，会怎么样？”

　　“但是贝尔纳，你的这些言论实在太可怕了。”

　　“你不想要自由吗，列宁娜？”

　　“我没明白你的想法，我始终是自由的，有享受美好时光的自由。如今每个人都幸福快乐。”

　　他大笑道：“没错，‘如今每个人都幸福快乐’，从孩子五岁开始我们就这样教育他们。可是，你不想换一种方式自由地拥有幸福吗，列宁娜？你自已选择的幸福。不是和其他人都一样的方式，而是你自己的方式。”

　　“我不明白你想说什么。”她转过身，声音里带着哀求，“我们回去吧，贝尔纳。这个地方让我厌恶。”

　　“跟我在一起你不开心吗？”

　　“当然开心，贝尔纳。只是这个可怕的地方让我讨厌。”

　　“我还以为在这儿我们能……更加接近彼此——你看这儿，除了大海和月亮，别无他物，比在人群里接近得多，甚至比在我屋里还接近。你明白吗？”

　　“我什么都不明白。”她语调坚定，绝对不能让她的“蒙昧”受污染。“什么都不明白。”她换了个语调，“当那些糟糕的念头出现时，为什么不吃点唆麻？那样你就能把它们通通忘掉，剩下的就只有快活，无比地快活了。”列宁娜妩媚地笑了笑，试图以这种性感淫逸的方式来劝服他，尽管她的眼神里仍然流露出一种迷惑的焦虑。

　　他一声不响，严肃坚定地盯着她，毫无反应。几秒钟后，列宁娜收回了她那期待着的眼神，发出一声无预兆的短笑，试图找出新话题，却无能为力。僵持在沉默中。

　　贝尔纳终于开口了，声音低沉而疲惫。“好吧，”他说，“我们回去吧。”他狠劲地踩下加速器，像火箭似的冲上了天空。在四千米高的时候他开始启动螺旋桨，两人在天上沉默地飞行了一两分钟，贝尔纳突然大笑起来。列宁娜觉得他笑得很奇怪，但不管怎样，他终究是笑了。

　　“感觉好些了吗？”她鼓起勇气问。

　　他的回答是，从操纵器上抬起一只手，环抱住她，开始抚摸她的乳房。

　　“谢天谢弗德，”她心想，“他恢复正常了。”

　　半小时后他们回到了贝尔纳的房间里。一口气吞下四片唆麻的贝尔纳，打开收音机和电视，便开始解衣。

　　第二天下午两人在屋顶上约会时，列宁娜很调皮地问道，“怎样，你觉得昨天玩得尽兴吗？”

　　贝尔纳点点头。二人上了飞机。一阵微震后，出发了。

　　“大家都说我很丰满。”列宁娜拍着双腿，若有所思地说。

　　“是很丰满！”可是贝尔纳的眼神中却流露出痛苦，“像一团肉。”他心想。

　　列宁娜有些焦急地抬头看他，“你不会是嫌我太胖吧？”

　　他摇摇头。但心里想的却是：像一堆肉。

　　“你觉得我好吗？”他还是点点头。“任何地方都好吗？”

　　“简直完美无瑕。”他大声说道，但心里却想，“这是她定义自己的方式。她并不介意自己是一团没有灵魂的肉。”

　　列宁娜露出了胜利的笑容，但是她得意得太早。

　　“尽管如此，”贝尔纳稍作停顿后说，“我仍然希望我们昨天不是那样结束的。”

　　“不那样结束？还能有别的形式结束吗？”

　　“我不希望是用我俩上床的方式结束。”他清楚地解释。

　　列宁娜猛然一惊。

　　“不是马上上床，前一天就上床。”

　　“那应该是怎么样？”

　　他开始说很多晦涩难懂又极其危险的胡话，列宁娜想方设法阻止那些胡言乱语钻进她的大脑，可总是有漏网之鱼。“……试试控制我的冲动会有什么结果，”她听着，心灵的某根弦似乎被触动了。

　　“及时行乐。永远别把欢乐推迟。”她郑重地说。

　　“每周两次，从下午两点到四点半，每次重复两百遍。”他这样评价。他继续肆意发表着疯狂的谬论，“我想知道什么是激情，我想感受一些强烈的东西。”

　　“个人动了感情，社会就会动荡。”列宁娜说道。

　　“让社会晃一下有什么不好？”

　　“贝尔纳！”

　　但是贝尔纳丝毫未感到羞耻。

　　“成年人是理智和工作，”他接着说，“感觉和欲求是孩子。”

　　“弗德喜欢孩子。”

　　对于她的插话，他未予理会。“那天我突然觉得，”贝尔纳继续说道，“想一直持续成年人状态还是有可能的。”

　　“我不懂。”列宁娜态度强硬。

　　“我知道你不会懂的。我们昨天上了床，像孩子一样，成人会懂得等待。”

　　“可是很好玩，”列宁娜坚持己见。“难道不是吗？”

　　“好玩到极致了。”他答道，然而声音里有出乎寻常地悲切，表情里深藏着挣扎与痛苦。列宁娜的胜利感瞬间烟消云散，也许，他就是嫌她太胖了吧。

　　“我早就跟你说过。”列宁娜找法妮倾诉遭遇时，法妮如是说，“这一切都是因为他的代血浆里掺多了酒精。”

　　“无论如何，”列宁娜口气很肯定，“我确实喜欢他。他那双手——简直是太棒了。还有他耸动肩膀的样子——真令我心醉神迷，”她叹了一口气，“要是他不那么另类就好了。”

　　在主任办公室门口站了一会儿的贝尔纳，深吸了一口气，端正了身姿，准备迎接即将到来的抵触和反对——他知道进了这屋后这一切都是不可避免的。他敲敲门，便走了进去。

　　“有份证件请您签字批准，主任。”把证件放在写字台上，他尽可能轻快地说。

　　主任看他的眼神里流露出不满，但这证件上方是世界总统办公室的大印，下方则是穆斯塔法·蒙德总统阁下的亲笔签名，笔迹又粗又黑，遒劲有力。材料里的每一项都清清楚楚，主任根本没有办法拒绝，只能用铅笔签上了他姓名的首字母——在穆斯塔法·蒙德下面签上。两个灰色的字母立在那里，显得卑微无助，寒碜极了。他本打算沉默地将证件还给他，却无意中瞄到了正文里的几句话。

　　“你要去新墨西哥的保留地？”他抬头看着贝尔纳，一脸焦虑和惊讶。他的惊讶使贝尔纳觉得很诧异，他点点头。屋子里陷入了片刻的沉默。

　　主任身子往椅背一靠，皱着眉头说：“那事儿到现在多少年了？”与其说他在跟贝尔纳说话，不如说他在自言自语。“我看有二十年了。不对，应该多少有二十五年了。当时我的年纪应该与你相仿……”哎，他长叹了口气，接着摇了摇头。

　　贝尔纳感到很别扭。像主任那样传统守旧循规蹈矩的人，竟然会这般地失态！他简直想埋头跑出屋去。这倒不是因为他见不得别人回忆过去——那种偏见完全是出于睡眠教学的训练，是他（自认为）早已经完全摆脱了的。让他觉得窘迫的是主任不赞成这事——但是，既然不同意，为什么又背叛原则，去做被严令禁止的行为呢？受到了什么内在驱动力吗？虽然别扭，贝尔纳还是迫不及待地想听下去。

第12章 (2)


　　“那时，我恐怕和你有一样的主意，”主任说道，“想见识下野蛮人。拿到了去新墨西哥的批准书之后，我打算跟当时的女朋友一起去那儿度暑假。她是一个贝塔减，我想。”（他双眼微闭）“我觉得她的头发应该是黄色的，总之很丰腴，特别的丰腴，妩媚动人，这些我都记忆犹新。嗯，我记得我们在那经历了很多，看到了野蛮人，也骑马到处跑。然而，大概就是在假期最后一天，她不见了。我们俩在山上骑马，天气出奇地闷热，让人窒息。吃过饭，我们就去午睡。至少我的确是睡了。她应该是一个人出去溜达。反正，当我醒来时她并没在房间。当时，一场可怕的暴风雨正凶猛地袭过来，雷电交加，倾盆暴雨。我们的马也乘机挣脱缰绳逃走了。我本想勒住它们，却不慎摔倒弄伤了膝盖，根本走不了什么路。可我还是边喊边找，边找边喊，却连个人影都没有见着。我猜没准她已经一个人回去了，于是又沿原路爬下山谷。中间，我受伤的膝盖疼得不行，可唆麻又被我弄丢了。走了几个小时，直到深夜，我才终于回到住处，可是她还是不在，还是不在。”主任不断重复着，沉默片刻。“嗯，”他还是继续说了下去，“第二天我又开始找，但她依旧杳无音讯。她一定是在什么地方失足掉进山沟了，或是喂了山中的狮子。只有弗德知道！总之，那真是可怕极了，悲痛欲绝，我敢说肯定超出了应有的极限——毕竟，这种意外是有可能发生在每个人身上的；不过就算构成社会的细胞发生变化，整个社会集体仍然可以永世留存。”然而，睡眠教学的安慰作用似乎不大凑效。主任摇了摇头，“事实上，我还是时不时地梦见这段经历，”他的声音变得很低沉，“在梦里面，我被震耳的雷声吓醒，但她却不见了；在梦里面，我自己一个人在树下不断地寻找再寻找。”他缄默了，似乎精神还停留在那段回忆里。

　　“您一定受到了严重的惊吓。”贝尔纳近乎嫉妒地说道。

　　听到了贝尔纳这番话，主任才突然意识到自己方才的失态，一种罪恶感开始悄悄滋生。他瞥了贝尔纳一眼，小心地回避着他的眼神，脸上一片通红；又瞥了他一眼，突然产生了疑心，更为自己刚才说了那么多有失身份的话而气愤。“别想歪了。”他说，“别以为我跟那姑娘有什么不得体的联系。我们之间没有情感，更没有扯不清的关系，一切都很正常，很健康。”他把签过名的批准书还给了贝尔纳。“我真想不通自己怎么会用这件琐碎的往事打扰你。”他有些恼羞成怒，埋怨自己透露了一个不光彩的秘密，却又把怒气撒到了贝尔纳身上。主任的目光里突然透出明显的恶意。“趁此机会，我想告诉你，马克斯先生，我收到了你的业余时间行为的报告，对此我很不满意。你可能觉得这事与我无关，可这就是我的职责。我得维护本中心的名誉。我不能接受这里的工作人员受到质疑，尤其是最高种姓的人。阿尔法有特殊的条件设置，即他们在情感上不一定要像婴孩，可正是如此，他们才更应该努力遵守规则。就算自身不情愿，也应该承担责任，要表现得像个婴儿一样。正是这样，马克斯先生，给你一个郑重的警示。”他的声音颤抖起来，之前出自尴尬而产生的怒气已经消失了，现在是因为正义感和无私而愤怒，好像是代表社会在进行谴责。“如果我再次听到你违背行为规范，我会申请把你调走，去下级中心——最好是冰岛。再见。”他抓起笔写了起来。

　　“这样可以好好教训下他。”主任心想。不过显然，他的设想太过美好。贝尔纳“砰”的一声关上门，大摇大摆、欣喜若狂地走出房间，他为自己孤军一人挑战现有的社会规则而骄傲无比。他突然深刻地意识到自己的存在和重要性，陶醉于其中，愈发兴奋。就算即将面临困境他也不会妥协，反而会更精神抖擞。他觉得自己有足够的力量去面对困难，战胜困难，甚至有能力面对冰岛。他之所以这么自信，也是因为他不相信人家真的会让他去面对这些。没有人会因为这种理由而被调离岗位。关于冰岛，那只不过是一种恐吓，一种激发斗志、振奋精神的恐吓。他在走廊里大步向前，居然还吹起了口哨。

　　英勇豪迈——这是他对当天会见主任时的自我表现所做的评述。“随后，”他用此段话做了总结，“我就是告诉他滚回过去的无底洞吧，然后大步流星地离开。如此而已。”他热切地望着亥姆霍兹·沃森，等待着他的同情、鼓励和钦佩。可是亥姆霍兹却一言不发，安静地坐那儿，盯着地板。

　　他一直喜欢贝尔纳；也很感激他，因为在他所相识的人群里，他是唯一一个能跟他探讨一些重要话题的人。不过，贝尔纳身上也有让他厌恶的缺点，比如他总爱吹牛，夸夸其谈，但有时身上又会出现一种带奴性的自哀。他还有个可悲的毛病，爱在事后充英勇、冷静。可正是因为亥姆霍兹喜欢贝尔纳，他才讨厌这些毛病。时间一分一秒地走着，亥姆霍兹还是呆呆地看着地板。贝尔纳突然脸红了，转过身去。

　　一路风平浪静。蓝太平洋火箭提前两分半钟到达新奥尔良，过德克萨斯州时遇上龙卷风延误了四分钟，在西经九十五度又幸运地遇上顺行气流，所以最终到达圣塔菲时只比原定时间迟了四十秒钟。

　　“六个半小时的航程只迟到四十秒，还不错。”列宁娜赞赏道。

　　那天晚上他们睡在圣塔菲。旅馆豪华得无与伦比，列宁娜去年夏天住过的极光宫和这里完全无法相提并论。房间里配备了液态空气、电视、真空振动按摩、收音机、热咖啡因液、避孕用品，连卧室的香水都有八种，贴心极了。进大厅时合成音响正播放着美妙的乐曲，让他俩顿时觉得能住在这里真是件幸运的事情。电梯里还贴着张通知，告诉客人旅馆里设有六十个自动扶梯壁球场，公园里还能玩障碍高尔夫和电磁高尔夫。

　　“听起来美妙极了！”列宁娜赞叹道，“我真希望能常住于此。有六十个自动扶梯壁球场……”

　　“保留地可一个都没有，”贝尔纳提醒她，“也没有香水和电视，甚至连热水都没有。你要是不能忍受，最好是待在这儿等我回来。”

　　列宁娜不由得生气了：“我百分百能受得了。我只是说这儿很美好，因为……因为进步总是美好的，对不对？”

　　“从十三岁到十七岁，每周都要重复五百次。”贝尔纳小声说道，像是自言自语般，声音里有种显而易见的厌倦。

　　“你在讲什么？”

　　“我是说进步是美好的，所以你没有必要去保留地，除非你真心地想去。”

　　“可是我是真想去。”

　　“好吧。”贝尔纳说，这句话像是一种恐吓。

　　他们的批准书需要保留地的总督签字，第二天一大早两人就来到了总督的办公室。一个伊普西龙加黑人门房把贝尔纳的名片送了进去后，很快就被准许接见了。

　　那是个金头发白皮肤的阿尔法减，小个儿，大圆脸，面色红润，肩膀宽阔，他的声音洪亮有磁性，十分适合用来表现睡眠教学里的深刻道理。他像是一座矿藏，里头全是不相关的信息和没有用的建议，一旦开启了话题，他就没完没了地开始说起来。

　　“……把五十六万平方公里明确地划分成了四块保留区，区与区之间界限明确，由高压电网隔离。”

　　这一刻，毫无原因地，贝尔纳突然想起了在离开家时他忘了关掉浴室的古龙水龙头，香水还在不停地喷洒。

　　“……是由大峡谷水电站保证隔离网高压电的供应。”

　　“等到我回去时肯定已经白白地流掉好多钱了。”他仿佛看见了香水仪表上的指针还在一圈圈地走着，好似蚂蚁般地不知疲倦。“我得赶快跟亥姆霍兹·沃森通个话。”

　　“……有五千多公里电网，电压则为六千伏特。”

　　“不可能吧？”列宁娜客气地说。实际上她并不明了总督究竟说什么，只是从他那戏剧性的停顿中得到了某种暗示而已。她在总督的大嗓门开闸之前就已经偷偷地吞服了半克唆麻，因此才可以心平气和地坐那儿，充耳不闻，神游太虚，不过还是得保持用她那蓝色的大眼睛故作认真地盯住总督的脸。

　　“一旦接触电网，顷刻即亡！从保留地里溜出去那就更不可能了。”

　　“溜”这个字给了他一种暗示。“也许，”贝尔纳挺直身子，准备站起来，“我们得告辞了。”那小黑针正快步急走着，像一只饥虫，侵蚀着时间，也侵蚀着他的钱。

　　“溜出去是不可能的。”总督反复地说着，摆手示意他们回到自己的位子上。贝尔纳也只得照做，毕竟批准书的字还没签。“所有出生在保留地的人，记着，可爱的女士，”他颇为猥琐地盯着列宁娜，轻浮地低声说道，“记着，在保留地，孩子还是胎生的。没错，虽然这很叫人厌恶，但他们确实是生下来的……”（他希望列宁娜会因为这个下流的话题而脸红，岂料她只是机械性地微笑说道：“不可能吧。”总督大失所望，只得继续说下去。）“我得强调：生在保留地的人，死也注定要在这个地方。”

　　注定会死……一分钟十分之一升古龙香水，一小时就是六升。“也许，”贝尔纳又想告辞，“我们应该……”

　　这时，总督弯下身子，食指叩了叩桌子，“如果你问我有多少人住在保留地，那么，我的回答将会是”——他不禁得意起来——“我不知道，只能靠猜测。”

　　“真的吗？”

　　“我可爱的女士，是真的。”

　　六乘以二十四……不，应该有六乘以三十六了。贝尔纳脸没了一丝血色，焦急得发颤。可那个“嗡嗡”的说话声还在无情地唠叨中。

　　“……差不多有六万印第安人和混血儿……都是百分百的野蛮人……我们的监察官偶尔会去视察……在此之外，与文明世界便无丝毫交集……那里至今还保留着他们那些令人作呕的习惯和风俗……婚姻，如果你明白是什么意思的话，可爱的女士；还有家庭……没有条件设置……极端荒谬的迷信行为……基督教、图腾崇拜还有祖先崇拜……早已灭绝了的语言，比如祖尼语和西班牙语、阿萨巴斯卡语……美洲狮、箭猪和其他凶猛的动物……传染病……祭司……毒蜥蜴……”

　　“不可能吧。”

　　最终，他们总算得以脱身。贝尔纳飞奔到电话前。快！快！可单拨通亥姆霍兹的电话就浪费了他将近三分钟。“我们是已经在野蛮人中间了吗？”他埋怨道，“真他妈没效率！”

　　“要不来一克吧。”列宁娜好心提议。

　　他不肯，宁愿在那生气。后来，感谢弗德，终于通了，是亥姆霍兹。他向亥姆霍兹讲述了刚发生的事，亥姆霍兹允诺即刻去关龙头，即刻去，好，马上去。不过亥姆霍兹也趁此时告知了他关于昨天夜里主任在开会时做的讲话……

　　“你说什么？他正寻找人来替代我？”贝尔纳的语气显得很苦涩。“已经确定了吗？他提及调往冰岛的事没？他真的提到了？哦，弗德！那可是冰岛啊！……”他挂了电话，转身对着列宁娜，面色苍白，表情极端沮丧。

　　“出什么事了？”她问。

　　“什么事？”他往后一靠，无力地倒在椅子上，“我将被调到冰岛去了。”

　　他曾多次设想过要经受一些严峻的考验（是靠他的内在力量，不用唆麻），体验如临深渊般的痛，尝试遭受迫害的感觉，寻找苦难的感觉。就是一周前，在主任的办公室里，他还想象过自己实行了伟大的反抗，坚忍地默默承受了苦难。主任的威胁反而让他兴奋，让他觉得自己的形象伟岸多了。可是直到现在他才意识到，他实际并未认真地思考过主任的恐吓言辞。因为他根本就不相信，主任会对此实施任何手段。如今看来，那恐吓要变为现实了。贝尔纳面如白纸，惊愕不已，他那想象中的坚忍和勇气此时早已消退得无影无踪。

　　他跟自己生起气来——真是个蠢货！——敢跟主任对着干——真不公平，居然没给他再一次机会。如果有第二次机会，他绝对会全力以赴争取的。可是冰岛，冰岛……。

　　列宁娜摇了摇头。“过去和未来都叫我痛苦，”她引用道，“吞下唆麻现在就幸福。”

　　最终他被她说服，吞下了四片唆麻。五分钟以后，一切烦恼之根果皆消除，只剩下当下之花正灿烂地绽放。门房带来了消息，按照总督的指示，一个保留地卫士开来了一架飞机，在旅馆屋顶候命。他们立即去了屋顶。一个穿绿制服的伽玛混血儿（一般指有八分之一黑人血统的黑白混血儿）敬了个礼，便开始向他们报告上午的安排。

　　首先，有十来个首要的印第安村庄待他们在空中鸟瞰，接着会降落在马尔佩斯享用午餐。那里的招待所比其他的要舒适，而且村里的野蛮人可能要欢度夏令节，因此，在那儿过夜是再惬意不过了。

　　他们就座后，飞机就出发了，十分钟后便穿过了文明社会与野蛮区的交界。飞机不太平稳地飞过盐漠、沙漠与森林，深入大峡谷的紫色阴影里，跃过峭壁、山峰和台地。绵延的电网像条势不可挡的直线，在地面上勾画着代表人类征服意志的几何图腾。电网之下星星点点地分布着白骨，黄土地上还残留着未完全腐烂的深色尸体，应该是被腐腥味招来的野鹿、公牛、豹子、箭猪、郊狼或是贪婪的兀鹰，它们靠近了致命的电线，挨了电击，遭受了罪有应得的审判！

　　“他们从不引以为戒，”身着绿色制服的驾驶员指着机下的茫茫白骨说道，“也从未打算引以为戒。”他又补充一句，笑了，仿佛从被电死的动物身上得到了一种自我成就感。

　　贝尔纳也露出了笑容，两克唆麻下肚，不知为何，这些玩笑听着觉得风趣了。片刻之后，他便倒头沉睡了起来。睡梦中他飞跃了陶斯、特苏基，飞过了南姆、比克里司和波瓦基，飞过了西雅和克奇逖，飞过了拉古纳、阿科马和被下过咒的高山台地，飞过了祖尼、锡沃拉和奥左卡连特。等飞机降落时，他终于从梦中醒了过来，看见列宁娜提着箱子走进一间方形的小屋，那个穿伽玛绿的混血儿正跟一个印第安青年用他们完全不懂的语言对话。

　　“马尔佩斯，”贝尔纳下飞机时驾驶员随即解释道，“这就是招待所。印第安村里会有一场舞会，就在今天下午。他会带你们去。”他指着那个闷闷不乐的印第安青年说。“希望你们能玩得尽兴。”驾驶员撇开嘴笑道。“他们做的事情都很有意思。”刚说完，就上了飞机，启动了引擎。“记住，明天我会来接你们！”他向列宁娜郑重承诺，“他们被驯服得很听话，您大可放心，绝对不会伤害你们一根汗毛。他们挨过太多的毒气弹，所以不会跟我们玩任何花样。”他笑着给直升机螺旋桨挂了挡，一踩加速器飞走了。

第13章 (1)


　　远看平顶山，像一艘船静静停泊在棕黄色沙尘的海湾边。海峡在险峻的山谷间蜿蜒前行，来回撞击一道道崖壁，直到穿过山谷，一片绿色便映入眼中——那是河流和原野。海峡中央“石船”的船首处头，露出一片形状整齐的光滑岩层，马尔佩斯印第安人村就坐落于此处，仿佛是“石船”的组成部分。村里的高楼是一层层堆积起来的，越高的楼层体积越小，犹如被蓝天削去顶端的金字塔。下面是零零散散的小屋和纵横交错的围墙。悬崖的三面倾斜而下融入平原。此时没有风，几缕炊烟笔直上升，而后消散到空气中。

　　“真古怪！”列宁娜说，“太古怪了。”这个词是她谴责抱怨时的口头禅。“我不喜欢这里，也不喜欢那个人。”她指着那个受命护送他们去蛮族村落的印第安向导说。很显然，向导也抱有相同的情绪。他远远地站在前面，背影透露着敌意和不屑的愠怒。

　　“而且，”她细声说，“他身上怪臭的。”

　　贝尔纳没有提出异议。他们继续前行着。

　　忽然，似乎周遭的空气都开始雀跃激动起来，体内的血液也跟着不知疲倦地翻腾着——在高处的马尔佩斯，有人正在敲鼓。伴着心跳一般神秘的节拍，他们加快步伐，沿路走到悬崖底下。他们头上则耸立着那硕大的“石船”的峭壁，地面距离“船舷”整整三百米。

　　“早知道就带飞机过来了，”列宁娜仰望着那高耸入云的峭壁，愤恨地说，“我不喜欢走路，尤其是在高山脚下走路，显得自己微不足道。”

　　他们在平顶山的阴影下里继续行进，绕过一排岩石，在一道水蚀皱谷中，有一条小径通向“舰艇扶梯”。他们开始往上爬。山路险峻，扶梯于山谷两侧晃来晃去。有节奏的鼓声有时微弱得几乎听不见，有时又仿佛近在拐角处。

　　爬到半山腰时，一只苍鹰擦身飞过，脸上还能感觉到它的翅膀带来的一股凉气。忽见岩石的裂缝内有一堆白森森的骨头。一切都散发着诡异而压抑的气氛，而印第安向导的气味也越发浓重。终于，他们走出了阴沉的峡谷，迎接来阳光。远眺那平顶山的头顶就像一块平整的“甲板”。

　　“很像切林t字形塔楼。”列宁娜评述道。还没等她多观赏一会这个让她自豪的发现，一阵轻快的脚步声传过来，他们转身朝声音方向望去，只见两个印第安人，赤裸着上身，黑棕色的身子上画着一道道白条（后来列宁娜描述说“好像铺满沥青的网球场”），脸上布满猩红色、黑色和赭色的涂料，不像是人的模样。他们的黑发编成辫子，饰以狐狸毛和红色的法兰绒，肩膀上围着的火鸡毛迎风扑扇着，头上戴着硕大鲜艳的羽毛头冠。银手镯、骨制项链和绿松石珠串随着脚步发出叮叮当当的响声。两人穿着鹿皮靴，步履轻盈地跑上前来。其中一人握着一把羽毛掸子，另一人两只手好像各抓了三四条粗绳，其中一条不安分地摇摆着。列宁娜惊奇地发现那竟然是蛇。

　　两人越来越近；他们那黑亮的眼睛早瞧见了她，却毫无表示，丝毫没有似曾相识或在意她的神情。那条摇摆的蛇松软地垂了下去，跟别的蛇一样悬挂着。两人就这么走开了。

　　“我不喜欢这儿，”列宁娜说，“很不喜欢。”

　　可是，更叫她不喜欢的还在村口等待着她。在那儿，向导径直把他俩扔下，自己去接受指令了。先是肮脏的泥土，再来是垃圾堆、灰尘、狗、苍蝇！她的脸不自觉地扭成一团，表达出极度的厌恶，同时拿出手绢捂住了鼻子。

　　“他们这样怎么活得下去？”她愤慨地喊道，深深地觉得不可思议。（太离谱了！）

　　贝尔纳耸了耸肩，很富哲理性地说：“说到底，五六千年来他们都如此生活，现在估计早就习以为常了。”

　　“可是‘清洁卫生，弗德开心’。”她不服气地说。

　　“没错，‘文明意味着完全杀菌’。”贝尔纳嘲讽地引用了睡眠教学卫生基础知识第二讲的名言。 “但是，我主弗德对他们来说是闻所未闻的，他们可不是文明人。所以说这些也没有意义……。”

　　“啊！”她捏了一下他的胳臂，“快看！”

　　附近一幢房子二楼的平台上，一个近乎全裸的印第安人正沿着楼梯小心翼翼、颤巍巍地往下爬。那是一位年迈的老人，肤色黝黑，皱纹很深，好像戴了个黑曜石面具。那早已掉光了牙的嘴凹陷下去。下颚及嘴边两端有几根长长的胡须，与黝黑的肤色一对比，仿佛闪着白光。蓬乱的头发并没有编成辫子，披散在脸边，掺着灰白的发丝。他瘦得皮包骨头，身躯弯成了弓形。他沿着楼梯缓慢地走下来，每挪一步，就要靠着扶手歇一歇，然后冒险地踏出下一步。

　　“他怎么会这样？”列宁娜悄声问道，睁大的眼睛里写满了恐惧和诧异。

　　“只不过是上年纪了。”贝尔纳尽可能表现得毫不在意。实际上他也感到很震撼，只是想尽力隐藏这种情绪。

　　“上年纪了？”她重复了一遍答案，“可是主任不也老了吗，那么多人都老了，没有人像他这副模样。”

　　“那是因为我们不允许他们衰老。我们阻止他们生病，通过人工调节，让内分泌系统维持年轻时候的平衡状态。镁钙比值从来不能低于三十岁的水平。还要时不时地注射年轻人的血液，永久性地刺激新陈代谢。所以，他们自然不会老成那样了。另外，”他补充道，“这儿绝大部分人还活不到这个老家伙的年龄。这些人到六十岁时身体还很健康，没有任何损伤，然后，‘咔嚓’，突然一下就完了。”

　　但列宁娜早就没心思听他说话了。她呆呆地注视那老人，看着他缓慢且迟钝地向下爬，脚落了地，转过身来。深深凹陷的眼窝里，双眼异常的明亮。老人面无表情地看着她，没有一丝惊讶，好像她根本不存在一样。然后他缓缓地挪动佝偻的身体，从他们身边擦过。

　　“这儿可真恐怖，”列宁娜气息微弱地说，“真可怕，我们就不该来这儿。”她慌忙地伸手去摸兜里的唆麻，却发现自己史无前例的疏忽：唆麻给忘在招待所了。贝尔纳的口袋也空无一物。

　　列宁娜只好无助地面对马尔佩斯的种种恐怖：恐怖的场面接二连三地发生。她看见两个年轻的母亲给孩子喂奶，羞得急忙扭过脸。她生平第一次见到如此下流猥亵的事。让她更窘迫的是，贝尔纳对这羞耻的胎生场面不仅没有及时回避，反倒公然表示感慨。之前服下唆麻渐渐失去效用，他开始为早上在招待所的懦夫表现感到羞愧，于是迅速改变态度，表现自己的强悍与对正统的挑战。

　　“多么美好的亲密关系啊，”他特意说得不堪入耳，“生育会产生多么深厚的感情啊！我时常思考：我们可能会因为没有母亲而缺失什么，而列宁娜，你也可能因为没有做过母亲而不完整。想象一下你坐在那儿哺育着自己的孩子吧……”

　　“贝尔纳！你怎么能胡说八道！”这时，她发现了一位患眼疾和皮肤病的老妇人，本来愤怒的她迅速转移了注意力。

　　“离开这儿吧，”她哀求他，“我真是一点都不喜欢这里。”

　　正说着，他们的向导回来了，示意他们跟在后面，带领着他们穿过房屋之间狭窄的街道，转过一个街角。垃圾堆里躺着一只死狗；一个长着甲状腺肿瘤的妇人在一个小女孩的头发里捉虱子。向导走到一个梯子旁边，停住了，然后竖直地举起手，朝水平方向一指。顺着他无声的指示，他们爬上梯子，踏进门，走进一个狭长的房间。阴暗的空间里弥散着一股难闻的烟味、食物的油脂味和久穿未洗的破衣服味。房间尽头又是一扇门，一束阳光射过，清晰地传来一阵喧闹的鼓声。

　　跨过门槛，他们看到一片广袤的平台。下面就是村落的广场，四周都是高高的建筑物，广场里挤满了印第安人：亮泽的毛毡，插着羽毛的乌黑头发，闪闪发光的绿松石，因为热情而发光的黝黑皮肤……列宁娜又忍不住拿出手绢捂鼻子。广场中央的空地上有两个圆形的平台，是用石头和结实的泥土筑成的，显然是地下室的房顶。因为在每个台子正中都开有一个天窗，隐约看见漆黑的天窗下面还架着楼梯。地下偶有笛声传来，却被持续不断的鼓声无情地掩盖。

　　列宁娜正陶醉在那鼓声中。她闭紧双眼，身体沉浸在轻柔反复的“雷鸣”中，任由其逐渐进入到她的意志，直到完全占领。末了，她的世界变得空悠悠，仅剩下一阵阵深沉的搏动。这声音让她欣然地回想起团结祈祷日和弗德庆典时所放的合成音乐。“纵情啊狂欢”，她自言自语地默念道。与这鼓点的节奏完全一样。

　　一瞬间，振聋发聩的歌声喷薄而出——几百个男人激烈地高声齐唱，整齐的声音像尖锐的金属；几个长音符之后，静了下来——雷鸣般的鼓点归于寂静。随后响起一阵高声部的女声，如马嘶般高亢尖锐，这是女人们的唱和。紧随其后的又是鼓点。接着，男人们那低沉的声音再次响起，用粗蛮的方式印证着他们的男性气魄。

　　古怪——毋庸置疑。地方怪，音乐怪，服饰、瘤子、皮肤病和老人都怪，不过这表演倒没那么奇怪。

　　“让我联想到低种姓的社区合唱。”她对贝尔纳说。

　　不过，接下来的场景就不那么让她好受了。一众面目狰狞的“魔鬼”瞬间从那圆形的地下室里钻了出来，头上戴着让人毛骨悚然的面具，完全辨别不出人脸的特征，围着广场正瘸瘸拐拐跳着一种奇怪的舞。一圈又一圈，边唱边跳，一圈又一圈，鼓点越来越急促，舞动的节奏也随之加快，就像发烧时剧烈跳动的脉搏。四周的人群跟着唱和起来，嗓音不断提升。人群中一个女人发出尖叫，其他女人一个接着一个地尖叫开来，仿佛要被杀掉一样。接着领舞人脱离了舞蹈的人群，跑到广场尽头的一个大木箱旁，揭开盖，随手拽出了两条黑蛇。“哇！”人群中爆发出欢呼，其他舞者都伸着手，向他跑去。领舞人把蛇扔向离他最近的一批人，然后又把手伸向柜子里，扔出一条条黑蛇、黄蛇和花蛇。舞蹈的节奏再次变换。舞员们手握着蛇一圈圈地舞着，双膝及腰部如蛇一样绕柔地摆动。此时领舞人发出指令，舞者们都把蛇扔向广场中心。从地下室钻出来一个老头，向蛇堆中抛撒玉米片。一个女人从另一个地下室钻了出来，从黑罐里舀出水来洒到蛇身上。然后老头双手举过头顶，现场突然静得惊人，一片死寂。鼓声停息，仿佛生命也即将停息。老头用手指了指通向地下室的两个洞口。被地下看不见的手推动着，一个洞口浮起一张鹰的画像，另一个洞口则升起一幅钉在十字架上的赤裸人像。两幅画仿佛无所依恃地兀自悬浮在空中，观察着人群。老人拍拍手，从人群中走出一个十八岁上下的小伙子，裸露着全身，独腰间缠着一块白棉布。小伙子两手交叉放在胸前，低着头站在老人面前。 老人在他头上画了一个十字，便转身离去。小伙子走向那堆扭动着的蛇群，围着绕起圈来。转完一圈，第二圈转到一半时，舞群中走出一个大高个，戴着野狼面具，手执一根皮鞭，朝小伙子走去。小伙子继续转圈，就像其他人不存在。“野狼”高举皮鞭，停了好一会，似乎在酝酿什么，忽然猛地一抽，鞭子呼啸地划过空气，打在了血肉之躯上，发出厚实响亮的声音。小伙子颤抖了一下，然后默不吭声地继续他那缓慢而坚定的步伐。“野狼”一鞭接着一鞭地抽过去，起初，每次抽打都让人群屏住呼吸，继而发出低沉的呻吟。小伙子接着转圈，两圈，三圈，走到第四圈时，身上涌出鲜红的血，五圈，六圈……列宁娜用手蒙住脸呜咽起来。“快阻止他们，让他们别打了！”她哀求道。但是鞭子还是毫不留情地挥舞，落下。七圈。小伙子摇晃着脚步，向前扑倒在地，依然没有出声。老头走到他面前弯下身，拿一根白色的长羽毛蘸取他背上的血，举起来向人群展示，触目的鲜红，然后在蛇堆上抖了三下。几滴血滴落。瞬间又响起激烈而紧张的鼓声，人群大声呼叫。舞者向前奔去，拽起蛇跑出了广场。男女老少们都蜂拥地跟随其后。不到一会儿，广场上就空荡荡的，只剩下那小伙子形单影只地趴在跌倒的地方，一动不动。不久，一间屋里走出三个老妇人，上前吃力地扶起他，拖进了屋子。只剩下那只鹰和十字架上的人守护着空寂的印第安村庄。过了一会儿，他们好像是看腻了似的，慢慢地下沉，回归到“地下世界”。

　　列宁娜还在哽咽，“太吓人了，太吓人了。”她不停地呼喊。贝尔纳怎么安慰都没有用。“那血！太吓人了！”她害怕得浑身哆嗦，“啊，要是带了唆麻就好了。”

　　房内传来脚步声。

　　列宁娜坐在那儿没有动，用手捂住脸不敢看，但贝尔纳还是转过头。

　　一个穿印第安服装的小伙子正走上台阶。不过，他那编成小辫的头发却是小麦金色，淡蓝色的眼睛，皮肤已晒成了古铜色，但是能看出来原先的皮肤是白的。

　　“哈罗，早晨好！”陌生人说的是英语，没有语病但有音调古怪。“你们是文明人吧？应该是从‘那边’来的，保留地外面，是吗？”

　　“怎么回事……？”贝尔纳大吃一惊地发问。

　　小伙子叹着气摇了摇头，“那个可怜人，”他指着广场中央的血迹说，“你们看见那该死的血迹了吗？”他用激愤而颤抖的语气问。

　　“一克唆麻，好过烦恼。”列宁娜捂着脸机械式地重复着，“要是带了唆麻就好了。”

　　“趴那儿的人应该是我，”年轻人接着说，“他们为何不拿我去献祭？我可以转十圈，十二圈，甚至十五圈。帕罗蒂瓦只转了七圈。从我身上，他们可以得到双倍的血，把一碧无垠的海水染成一片殷红。”他挥出双臂慷慨激昂地做了个手势，又失落地放了下来。“但他们不愿让我去。因为他们不喜欢我的肤色，他们一直都这样，一直都是。”泪水涌上了他的眼睛，年轻人羞愧地背过身去。

　　惊讶暂时医好了列宁娜对唆麻的渴求。她放下手，第一次看清楚眼前这个青年，“你是说你想挨鞭子？”

　　年轻人仍然背对着她，做了一个肯定的手势。“是的。为了村庄，为了降雨，为了作物的成长，为了让菩公和耶稣高兴，也为了证明我能够一声不吭地忍受痛苦，我愿意。”声音忽然变得响亮，他挺起胸膛，骄傲而不服气地扬起下颚，“为了证明我是顶天立地的男子汉……啊！”他目瞪口呆，屏住了呼吸，不再说话：他生平第一次遇见这样的姑娘，肤色并非是巧克力色或狗皮色；棕红色的头发自然地卷曲；脸上写满友好真切的关怀（新奇得难以置信）。列宁娜对他微笑。她正想着，这个小伙子真帅气，身材真好。小伙子的热血直往脸上涌，他赶紧低下头，好一会儿才抬起来，却发现她依然看着自己微笑。他不知所措，只好转过头去，装作在寻找广场对面的什么东西。

　　贝尔纳一连串地提问转移了注意力。他问小伙子是什么人，怎么来的，何时而来，又来自何处。小伙子盯着贝尔纳的脸（他热切地想再看看那姑娘的微笑，又不敢看她），简单地介绍了自己：在保留地，琳达和他都是外来人。琳达是他的妈妈（列宁娜一听妈妈两字就浑身不自在）。他出生之前，琳达和一个男人从 “那边”来到这里的，那男人就是他的父亲（贝尔纳竖起了耳朵）。当年，琳达独自一人从山上往北边走，不慎跌落山崖，撞破了头。（“快，接着说”，贝尔纳非常激动。）几个马尔佩斯的猎人发现了她，就把她带回了村庄。之后，琳达再也没有见过他的父亲。他的名字叫托马金（那就对了，主任的名字就是托马金。他一定是自己一个人飞回“那边”了，丢下孤苦无依的琳达——真是个铁石心肠的坏人）。

　　“于是我在马尔佩斯出生了。”他结束了自我介绍。“在马尔佩斯……”他摇摇头。

　　就在村庄外边那间肮脏的小屋里！

　　尘土和垃圾像一个屏障，把小屋划分出村庄。小屋门前的垃圾里，两条饥肠辘辘的脏狗正在猥琐地嗅着。他们走了进去，屋内又暗又臭，只听见苍蝇的嗡嗡声。

　　“琳达！”年轻人呼唤着。

　　“来了。”一个沙哑的女声回答道。

　　他们等待着。装着剩饭的碗散落在地上，可能是好几顿的剩饭。

　　门开了，只见一个肥硕的金发白肤印第安女人从门槛迈了进来，目瞪口呆地望着两个陌生的客人，傻傻地杵在那儿，不敢相信眼前的一切。但是她的形象却让列宁娜觉得反胃：那女人的两颗门牙都掉了，没掉的牙的颜色也……她不禁打了一个寒战，浑身起鸡皮疙瘩。比之前看到的老头还糟。她太肥了，脸上都是褶子，皮肉松弛，爬满皱纹，下垂的两颊上长着发紫的斑点。鼻子上鼓着红色的血管，眼睛里布满血丝。再看她那脖子——这还能称作是脖子吗……头上还裹着又脏又破的毛毡。麻袋形状的褐色长袍也不能遮掩那肥腻下垂的乳房、臃肿的肚子和臀部。啊，比那个老头的样子更无法忍受！突然，这个“怪物”开始唧唧呱呱地念叨，还张开双手向她跑来——弗德呀！弗德呀！那“怪物”一下抱住列宁娜，乳房和肚腩贴近过来，还亲吻她。弗德呀！真让人作呕，再这样下去她真要吐了。她唾沫飞溅地亲吻着，浑身恶臭，肯定从来没洗过澡。这气味跟放进德尔塔和伊普西龙瓶里的东西一样，很可能是酒精（关于贝尔纳的传言不会是真的吧）。列宁娜奋力挣脱开这恶心的怀抱。

　　她眼前的那张脏脸哭得又肿又歪，那“怪物”在哭诉着。

　　“哦，我的小宝贝。”不间断的絮叨中夹杂着啜泣声。“这么多年了，从没再看见过文明人的脸！你知道我有多高兴吗？真的，连文明人的衣服都看不到。我还以为永远都见不到真正的人造丝衣服了。”她伸出手触摸列宁娜的衬衫袖子和黑色的纽扣。“还有这迷人的粘胶棉绒短裤！我的宝贝，你知道吗？我仍保存着那些旧衣服，就是之前我穿来的，都好好地存放在箱子里，以后有机会让你们看看，虽然粘胶都破了。我还有条惹人爱的白腰带——我得承认，你这条摩洛哥绿皮带更加精致。”说着她的流泪又开始泛滥。“我想约翰已经告诉过你了，我在这里受尽了苦头，一点唆麻都没有。只能偶尔喝点波佩带来的龙舌兰酒。波佩是我以前的一个熟人。但喝完那酒以后特别难受。佩瑶特也是，而且喝了它，第二天会有一种可怕的羞耻感。我真觉得耻辱。你想想看，我，一个贝塔，居然生了个孩子出来，你站在我的角度想想看。”（听到这个提议列宁娜就颤抖起来）“但是这真的不是我的错，我发誓！我至今也不明白到底怎么出的错，我一向都按时做马尔萨斯操，你知道吧，按照顺序，一、二、三、四，没有偷懒过，我发誓。但还是出事了。当然，这里是没有人流中心的。顺便问一下，人流中心还在切尔西吗？”列宁娜点了点头。“星期二和星期五还是有泛光灯照明吗？”列宁娜又点点头。“那可爱的粉红玻璃大厦呀！”可怜的琳达抬起头，闭上眼。那记忆中的绚丽图景在她脑中如梦似幻地翻腾着。“还有那河上的夜色。”她低声说着，豆大的泪珠从她紧闭的眼角慢慢滑落。“夜晚从斯托克伯吉斯飞回家，冲一个热水澡，做一次真空振动按摩……啊！”她深深地吸了口气，摇摇头，再次睁开双眼，擤了两下鼻子，用手抹了把鼻涕，在自己的衣襟上一擦。“噢，不好意思。”她看见列宁娜本能地做出厌恶的表情，“对不起，我不该这么粗鲁，可是换做是你，没有手绢该拿什么擦鼻涕？我当初是多么的苦恼，到处是脏东西，都没有消过毒。他们把我带过来时，我头上有一个严重的伤口。你想象不到他们拿什么涂在伤口上，都是些污秽的东西。我老对他们说‘文明意味着完全杀菌’，甚至像带孩子一样对他们唱童谣：‘草色链球菌马儿，带我去班伯里t区，去t区有何贵干？去漂亮的洗手间看看。’尽管如此，他们还是不开窍。他们这些人怎么可能会明白呢？后来，我也就慢慢习惯了。这儿连热水管都没有安，怎么可能收拾得干干净净呢？你瞧瞧这些衣裳。这种野兽毛不像人造丝，总穿也不会有破损。如果破了，他们还要你缝补。我可是贝塔啊！工作一直是在受精室，从来没有人指导我做过这种粗活，毕竟这不是我工作范围内的事。更何况，文明人根本不需要缝补衣服。衣服破了洞就该扔了，换新装。‘越缝越穷’，不就是说的这个理儿吗？缝补是反社会的行径。可在这儿情况截然不同，如同跟一群疯子一起生活。他们做的每一件事都那么疯狂。”她环顾四周，只见约翰和贝尔纳已经走开了，在屋外的沙土和垃圾中不断徘徊，但她还是压低了嗓音，佝着腰亲密地凑过来了，列宁娜身体死板地往后一退。她还是靠得很近，列宁娜面额上的汗毛都被她的臭气吹动，这臭味足以用来毒害胚胎了。“比如说，”她用沙哑的声音轻声说，“他们这儿的男女关系太疯狂了，我跟你说，那是绝对的疯狂。人人属于彼此——他们也是这样吗？是吗？”她扯着列宁娜的袖子反问道。

　　列宁娜点了点头，把头扭到一边，换了一口气（她刚才一直是屏住呼吸的），然后设法再吸一口相对不那么污浊的空气。“哼，在这儿，一个人是不会属于多个人的。你要是以正常方式和男人相处，其他人反而说你不正经、反社会，然后厌恶你、鄙视你。记得有一次，一群凶婆娘来我家大闹了一场，因为她们的男人常常来找我。哼，怎么就不能来找我呢？之后，她们冲了过来……那场景实在太恐怖了！我真没法给你形容。”琳达赶紧用手捂住脸，身体瑟瑟地颤抖着。“这里的女人太可怕了；她们不仅疯狂，还残忍粗暴。可想而知，她们是不会懂得马尔萨斯操、培养瓶、换瓶程序这类东西的，所以她们会一直生孩子——跟狗一样。糟糕透了。一想到我竟然也……啊，弗德，弗德，弗德啊！不过话说回来，约翰是我心中最大的安慰。如果没有他，我真不敢想象会做出什么傻事。虽然他常常因为我和男人的关系而伤心……从他很小的时候起就这样了。记得有一回（那是在他稍大一点的时候），他甚至想杀死可怜的华西瓦——或者是波佩，仅仅是因为我跟他们上床了。我不知道怎么做才能让他明白，这是文明人都会做的事。也许疯狂是会传染的，约翰似乎从印第安人那儿感染了疯狂。因为他经常跟那些人在一起。即使他们对他的态度坏到极点，也从不让他参与集体活动。不过这未尝不是件好事。因为这样，我才能帮他设置条件。你想象不到这有多么困难。我有太多不懂的事情，而且我本来就没有义务懂这些事。当孩子问你：直升飞机是怎么飞的或者这个世界是谁造的——你也知道，如果你是个一直在受精室工作的贝塔，怎么可能答得上来？又能编出什么答案？”

第15章 (1)


　　屋外面，在一地沙尘和垃圾间（现在还得加上四条狗），贝尔纳与约翰正踱来踱去。

　　“我不能理解这一切。”贝尔纳说，“我们仿佛不是在同一个星球上生活，不是生活在同一个纪元。这里有母亲，有污垢，有耶稣，人会衰老，人还会生病……”他困惑地摇了摇头。“简直难以置信。除非你能阐明这一切，不然我永远也不能理解。”

　　“你要我阐述什么？”

　　“这个，”他的手指向印第安村庄，“那个”，村外边的那间房子。“这里发生的一切，你们全部的生活。”

　　“但是那有什么好讲的呢？”

　　“那你就从头说起，从你最初对世事有记忆时开始说。”

　　“啊，从我最初的记忆开始。”约翰的眉头皱了起来，陷入了沉思。

　　那时，天气酷热，他们吃了很多玉米饼和甜玉米。琳达说：“孩子，来躺我这儿。”母子俩躺在大床上。“唱歌”，琳达开始唱 “草色链球菌马儿，带我去班伯里t区”和“再见吧，宝贝班亭，你马上就要换瓶”。声音越来越低，渐渐听不真切……

　　这时，约翰被一阵声响震醒了，看见一个男人在和琳达说话，逗得琳达直笑。盖在身上的毛毯被那男人掀了开来。那人的头发编着，像两根黑色的麻绳，手臂上缠着一个漂亮的银臂镯，上面还嵌着蓝色的石头。那臂镯让约翰喜欢得不行，可他还是被吓到了。他把脸埋在琳达身子里，琳达抱着他，这给了他安全感。他听着琳达说着他不太能理解的话，“不可以，约翰还在这儿呢。”那人瞅了瞅他，然后面向琳达情意绵绵地又说了几句。琳达坚持着，“不可以。”只见那男人俯下身来面对着他。那张脸又大又恐怖，他那两条黑绳似的发辫触到了毛毯。“不行。”琳达急忙说，他感到她的手抱得更用力了。“不，不。”这时他的一条胳臂却叫那人抓住了，被抓得疼痛难忍，他嘶叫了出来。那人伸出另一只手想把他举起来。可是琳达仍然抱住他不放，“不可以，这不可以。”那人生气地说了两句，话语很短促。琳达突然松开了手。“琳达，琳达。”他一边蹬着一边挣扎着被那人抱到门口，打开门，把他放到屋子中央，然后出去把门拴住了。他慌忙站了起来，跑到门前，垫着脚将就着能够到那大门闩；他端起木闩用力往外推；但却打不开。“琳达。”他大声喊道，琳达却没有任何回应。

　　他又记得有一个大房间，房内非常阴暗。屋里摆放着稀奇古怪的木制品，上面拴着很多线，四周围着很多妇女。琳达说那是在编制毛毡，还要他坐在屋角，同所有孩子一起，而她则去帮女人们干活。而这期间他就一直在跟孩子们玩。突然，人们大声地嚷了起来，女人们正往外推着琳达。琳达哭了，她只好走出门。他跑上前去，问她那些女人因为什么发火。“因为我把东西弄坏了。”她答道，接着琳达也气坏了，“我怎么会懂她们那种野蛮的编织法？”她说着，“一群凶恶的野蛮人！”他马上又问野蛮人是什么。他们回家时看见在门口等候已久的波佩，他跟着进了屋子。波佩有一个大葫芦，里边盛着类似水的液体，但不是水，而是种发臭又烧嘴，喝过之后让人咳嗽不已的液体。琳达和波佩每人都喝了一些，接着琳达便开始放声大笑和喧哗着，然后她便跟波佩步入了别的屋子……他在波佩走掉以后走进屋去，发现琳达躺在床上，睡得很死，怎么都叫不醒她。

　　当时波佩到访得很频繁，他称葫芦里的液体为龙舌兰酒，但琳达却叫它唆麻，可就是喝过之后浑身难受。他对波佩是厌恶的，同样厌恶周围所有的人——所有跟琳达有接触的男人。那是一个下午，他正在跟别的小朋友玩耍——他依稀记得，天特别冷，积雪覆盖在山上，他回到家中听见屋子内有暴怒的吼声。那声音是女人发出的，说着他不懂的话，但他能分辨出那些是不好的词句。接着，跟随着“叭”的一声，像是什么东西翻倒了。他听见屋内大家在快速地跑动。“叭”，又一个声响，然后就是鞭子抽打驴子的声音，可又不全像是抽打驴子，驴子身上的骨头更多些。琳达撕心裂肺地叫道：“啊！不，不要，不要再打了！”他冲进屋，看见有三个披着黑毯子的妇女，琳达则被架在床上：手腕被其中一个妇女按着；腿则被另一个妇女压着，别让她乱蹬；第三个妇女在不停地抽打着她。一鞭，两鞭，三鞭，鞭鞭都让琳达皮开肉绽。他被这幅场景吓倒，冲过去拉着那妇人的毡子边哭边喊着，“求求你们不要，求求你们不要。”那女人一手把他拉开了，继续抽了起来，琳达继续嘶喊着。他一把拽住那妇人棕色的手掌，拼尽全力咬了下去。那妇人开始叫喊，猛地缩回了手，狠狠地用手把他推到了地上，又趁他还没有爬起来，往他身上抽了三鞭子，那鞭子抽下来比他以往所感受到的所有的痛苦还要深刻——像火烧一样。鞭声又响起了，但这次嘶喊的却是琳达。

　　“为什么她们会打你，琳达？”他当天夜里问道。他在哭，因为自己背上那些血红的鞭痕还刺痛着；也因为大人们蛮横不讲道理；因为自己是个孩子，无力反抗。琳达也哭了。她虽然已经成年，可她孤身一人，敌不过三人的攻击。因此这对她来说也是不平等的。“为什么她们要伤害你，琳达？”

　　“不知道，我又怎么可能知道呢？”她躺在床上，把头埋在枕头里，声音听起来模糊不清。“她们说那是她们的男人。”她说着说着，听起来不像是跟他在说话；倒像是跟自己的心中的某人在倾诉。说了一大堆，其实她自己也不知道在说什么；最后她哭了，哭得比以往都惨烈。

　　“啊，不哭，琳达，不要哭。”

　　他贴近她，贴得格外近，小手搂住了她的颈部。琳达大叫了声，“哦，别碰我，我的肩膀！哎呦！”她用力一推。他的小脑袋磕在墙壁上。“小蠢蛋！”她骂着，继而开始扇他巴掌。“叭！叭！……”

　　“琳达，”他喊出了声，“哦，妈妈。不要打我！”

　　“你妈妈不是我，我才不想做你妈妈。”

　　“但是琳达……啊！”她又扇了他一巴掌。

　　“沦落成了野蛮人，”她喊道。“像禽兽一样生幼崽……如果不是因为你，我就会去找检查员，那样是有机会离开的。可不能领着孩子去。那真是丢尽了人。”

　　看见她又要动手，他便举起手臂来护着自己的脸。“哦，琳达，不要打，求你不要打我。”

　　“小畜生！”她拉下他的两只胳膊，看见了他的小脸。

　　“不要，琳达。”他喊着闭上了双眼，动也不动地等着被打。

　　可她这次并没有出手。等了好一会儿，他终于张开双眼，看见她正在望着他。他用力挤出了个勉强的微笑。突然，她用手抱住他，开始亲他，不停地亲吻着。

　　琳达有时会几天不出门，趴在床上暗自神伤，或是喝波佩送来的液体，喝够了开始狂笑，接着再睡。她生病的时候，会经常不记得要给他洗脸洗澡，那时他除了冷玉米饼再没有其他吃的。他还能想起琳达第一次在他头发里看见那些小虫子时，尖叫得没完没了。

　　每当她向他讲述“那边”的情况时便是最幸福的时候。“只要你想飞，无论何时，你就可以飞。”

　　“无论何时都行。”她告诉他，悦耳的音乐是从盒子里出来的，细细描述每一个游戏、每一道美味；想要光明只需按按墙上的按钮；图画可不只有颜色，还有声音、味道和触感；还有散发香味的盒子；山一样高的楼房，五彩缤纷。那儿每个人都很开心，不会有人哀伤或愤怒。每个人都属于其他人。还有些盒子是让你看到听到世界另一头发生了什么，还有瓶子中的婴儿——全部都洁净如新，没有恶臭，没有污垢，没有人觉得孤独，大家其乐融融生活在一起，像这里的夏令舞会一样。但一切都比这要快乐得多，每天都要快乐得多……他听着，时间一小时一小时地流逝。有时，他跟小伙伴们玩累了，也会去听村落里的老人讲故事。讲伟大的创世者的故事；讲右手跟左手、干和湿之间的长期斗争的传说（即西方密教的传说中代表正义的白魔法与代表邪恶的黑魔法的斗争）；讲晚上一动思想就出了大雾，然后又把全世界从雾里救出来的阿沃纳微罗那（他是祖尼印第安人神话中的造物者）的故事；讲地母和天父的故事；讲阿海雨塔和玛塞列玛（他们都是阿沃纳微罗那所造）——代表战争与机遇的孪生子；讲耶稣和菩公的传说；讲玛利和伊萨娜乐琪女神让自己青春重现的故事；讲拉古纳的黑石头和艾可玛的大鹰和圣母。尽是些不着边际的故事，由于是用另外的语言讲述，而且又听不大懂，所以他甚至觉得这些故事更有趣。他时常趴在床上幻想着天堂、伦敦、艾克马圣母、一列列小宝宝躺在消毒瓶里。天空中有耶稣，也有琳达，还有世界培育中心的主任，伟大的阿沃纳微罗那也在一起飞翔。

　　后来，越来越多的男人都过来找琳达。孩子们开始对他指指点点，他们用那陌生语言说琳达不是好人。他们侮辱她，他虽听不懂，却明白那不会是好话。有一天他们唱起歌来，内容是关于琳达的，一遍又一遍地唱。他拿石头扔他们，他们也毫不客气地回扔他，一块锋利的石头砸伤了他的脸，血开始不住地往外流，染得全身都是……

　　小时候琳达指导他认字，她在墙上用一块木炭绘画——有只小动物趴着，瓶子里装着一个婴儿，然后她简单地写了几个字：垫子上的小猫咪，瓶子里的小朋友。他很快就学会了，很容易。墙上所有的字他都学会后，琳达开启了她那大木箱，一本薄薄的册子藏在她那未曾穿过的滑稽红色短裤下。这本书，他之前也见过好几次。“当你成年了，”她说，“就可以读这本书了。”如今他终于长大了，这让他觉得很光荣。“你可能不喜欢这本书，”她说道，“但我的东西就只剩它了。”她长叹口气，“如果你能见着我们在伦敦常用的那些朗读机就更好了！”他开始朗读：《胚胎的条件设置——化学与细菌学》、《胚胎库工作守则——贝塔人员》。念个标题就用了十五分钟的时间。他把书甩到了地上，哭闹了起来：“讨厌，讨厌的书！”

　　孩子们依旧唱着那首关于琳达的歌曲，他们还经常讥笑他那破烂不堪的衣服。琳达根本不懂缝补，只好任由衣服破着。琳达跟他说如果在“那边”，只要是衣服破了点口子，一定要扔掉买新的。“破乞丐，破乞丐！”孩子们朝他嚷着。“但是我可以念书识字，”他想着，“他们不行，他们根本就不知道什么是读书。”每当他被嘲笑时，他只要专心想着还可以读书，便可以装着根本不在意他们的所作所为。所以，他又从琳达那要回了那本书。

　　孩子们越是对他指指点点，越是唱那首可怕的歌，他就越是勤奋。很快就能念出所有的字，就连最长的字符也不例外。可是这些词都代表着什么呢？每次问琳达，她都解释不清楚。其实绝大部分时候，她根本不知如何解释。

　　“化学药剂是什么意思？”他有时会问。

　　“哦，好比是镁盐，又或是一种酒精，能使德尔塔和伊普西龙瘦小、低智；再或是诸如用来制造骨头的碳酸钙。”

　　“可化学药品是如何生产的呢，琳达？从哪儿来的？”

　　“这我不清楚，每次我们都是直接从小瓶子里倒出来，用完了就再去仓库拿。我估计是产自仓库的人做的。不过也可能是他们派人去工厂那里拿来的，我真不清楚。我不是研究化学的。培育胚胎才是我的工作。”类似的问题他问了很多，但都没从琳达那得到过答案。反而村子里的老人却不同，他们的答案要明确得多。

　　“阿沃纳微罗那用繁衍神雾造出人和一切生物的种子，太阳的种子，大地的种子，天的种子。有四个子宫存在这世界上，在最低的子宫里放入这些种子。渐渐地，种子便开始发芽……”

　　一天（约翰事后推算应该是在他刚刚过完十二岁生日时），他在卧室里看到一本此前从未见过的书。厚厚的一本，式样很古老，封皮已经被老鼠嗑烂了；部分书页掉了下来，皱在一起。他弯腰拾起来，翻了翻，书名是《威廉·莎士比亚全集》。

第16章 (2)


　　琳达还趴在床上休息，正呷着一杯散发着恶臭的龙舌兰酒，“是波佩带过来的那本书。”她说。嗓音粗糙沙哑，听着根本就不像是她的声音。“原本存放在羚羊圣窟一个箱子里的这本书，一放就是好几百年。这也就配放在箱子里，我翻看了几页，里边竟是些胡诌八扯的东西，根本谈不上文明，但用来教你读书识字倒是不错。”最后一口下肚，顺手将杯子放在床下，扭身打了几个嗝，便睡着了。

　　他随便翻看着这本书，只见上面写道：

　　“不，生活在一张汗臭冲鼻、充满油垢的温床里；

　　只知道在腐堕里翻腾，在龌龊的猪窝里寻欢做爱。”

　　那些奇怪的话在他脑海中翻腾，犹如雷神激怒的咆哮；犹如夏令舞会上的鼓语——若是大鼓亦能言语的话；亦如男人激情演唱的玉米之颂，美妙！美妙！妙不可言，催人泪下；有如老米西玛对着他的羽翎，雕花手杖和碎石骨所念的咒语——卡萨拉，斯鲁，塞罗畏，塞罗畏，塞罗畏，嘅阿，斯洛，斯洛，斯色洛——但这又比米西玛的咒语要更神妙，内涵更深，因为那似一种互动，如在跟他对话；又叙述得如此精妙，让人似懂非懂，简直是一种美丽得慑人的咒语；这个叙述与琳达有关，那个躺在那儿打呼噜的琳达，还有床铺旁边地板上的空杯。它说的是琳达与波佩，琳达与波佩……

　　他越发的痛恨波佩。“有人能笑呀笑的，但仍然是个恶棍……一个不知悔改的、奸诈的、荒淫的、没有人性的恶棍。”这些句子要表达出什么意思？他仿佛知道却又不能完整地理解其中的意思，但是这个“咒语”强烈地吸引着他，如雷鸣般地刺激着他的每一根神经。他恍然醒悟，自己不曾真正地痛恨过波佩，因为他根本不知道如何描述他的恨意。此时他有了这些“咒语”，好似鼓声、歌声、巫术。这些“咒语”以及这个光怪陆离的故事（虽说他看不懂内容，但依然觉得精彩纷呈），这让他有了痛恨波佩的原因，让仇恨变得真实了，也让波佩本身更真实了。

　　一次，他玩耍后回到家，屋子的门敞开着，只见两人睡在一张床上——白白的琳达和在她对比下简直像黑炭一样的波佩。琳达枕着波佩的胳膊，乳房上是波佩的另一只手，他长长的辫子缠住了她的脖子，好像一条想要勒死她的黑蛇。床边的地板上放着波佩的葫芦和一个杯子。琳达鼾声四起。

　　他的心仿佛瞬间蒸发了，剩下一个洞。整个人被挖空了，空洞冰冷，他感到头晕恶心，整个世界都在转。他靠在墙上，“不知悔改的、奸诈的、荒淫的……”这些话在他脑海中反复回荡，回荡，如同激昂的鼓点，如慷慨玉米之颂，如神奇的咒语……忽然，他的身体由冰冷转为燥热，一股热血燃上了他的脸颊，眼前不停旋转的屋子，越来越暗。他咬紧牙齿愤愤说道：“我要杀了他。杀了他，杀了他！”突然更多的话语冒了出来：

　　“让我寻个更好的机会： 当他烂醉如泥、大发雷霆、淫榻寻欢……”

　　“咒语”与他在一条战线上同仇敌忾，咒语能解释一切并发号施令。他退出到屋子外。“当他烂醉如泥……”那火炉边的地板上就摆把切肉的刀子。他顺手抄起刀轻声走回屋前。“当他烂醉如泥，烂醉如泥……”他冲进屋去，直直地一刀插了进去，啊，血！——紧接着又是一刀。波佩从熟睡中惊醒过来，一把截住了他准备再次行刺的手，他的手腕被举了起来——哦，哦！被反拧开来。他再也动不了，已被降住了。波佩逼近他，用他那乌黑的小眼睛死死地盯着他的眼睛。他扭过头，看着别处，那两道伤口清晰地印在波佩的左肩上。“啊，看！血！”琳达在叫道，“有血！”她一直都不能直视流血的场面。他的另一只手被波佩举起——波佩要揍他，他心想着，于是挺直了身躯，等着被揍。但是那手只是扶正了他的下颚，好让他的脸转过来直视波佩的脸。他俩始终这么对视着，几小时后接着又是几个小时。这时，他忍不住哭了出来——因为他实在熬不住了。波佩大笑了起来，“走吧”，另一种印第安语从他嘴里说出，“走吧，勇敢的阿海尤塔。”约翰冲进了另外一间屋藏住他的眼泪去了。

　　“你已经十五了，”老米西玛用印第安话说，“现在我可以把制陶的技术传授给你了。”

　　于是两人一同蹲到了江边。

　　“第一步，”米西玛手捧一块潮湿的泥土说，“我们来把它变成月亮。”说着老头把泥土按成了一块饼，然后把饼周围的一圈立起来；月亮便成了个矮矮的杯。

　　他很生疏地、慢吞吞地模仿着老人。

　　“月亮，杯子，然后是蛇”，米西玛把另一坨泥巴搓成了一根长条，做成圆圈，粘在杯口上。“之后再做一条蛇，再一条，又是一条。”一圈圈地捏制出了罐子的边沿。那罐子本来很窄，然后鼓，到了罐口又变窄。米西玛开始挤、按、抹、割。罐子做好了，就跟最常见的水罐一模一样，只不过罐身是乳白，而不是黑色，而且摸起来很柔软。跟米西玛的罐子摆在一块，约翰的罐子是个蹩脚的山寨版。他对比着两个罐子，不由得笑了起来。

　　“熟能生巧。下一个会更好。”他打湿了另外的泥块。

　　土胚转啊转，慢慢地成型，他感觉自己的手开始变得娴熟有力——这让他找到了非同寻常的乐趣。“a，b，c 呀，维他命d，”他在自己的歌声中快乐工作，“肝脏里的脂肪，海洋中的鲟鱼。”米西玛也跟着唱了起来——不过歌词里讲的是杀熊的故事。整整一天的工作，使他体内充斥着酣畅淋漓的喜悦。

　　“等到明年的冬季，”老米西玛说，“让你学着做弓。”

　　他一直站在门外。屋子里的仪式终于办完了，人从打开的门里走了出来。领头的是科史鲁，他右手伸在前面，紧紧握着，仿佛里头有贵重的宝贝。跟在后面的是季雅纪美，同样她也伸出只手，紧紧攥着。他们静静前行，后面跟着同一辈的所有亲戚和村庄里全部的老人。

　　从印第安村落走出的他们，翻越了台地，最后在悬崖边上停了下来，面朝清晨的太阳。科史鲁终于张开了手，里头是一把白粉粉的玉米面，他对着玉米面一吹，低声地说了几句，然后对着太阳把手里的白色粉末撒了出去。季雅纪美也如是照做。接着是季雅纪美的父亲，他举起一根带羽翎的祈祷杖，祈祷了许久，然后把祈祷杖同玉米面一齐抛了出去。

　　“礼毕！”米西玛大声宣布道：“他们俩正式结为夫妇。”

　　“其实，”当人们转过身来时，琳达说道，“我唯一想说的是：这事也真是劳师动众。在文明世界里，一个男孩如果想得到一个女孩……喂，你要去哪，约翰？”

　　约翰没有理会她，只顾着跑，跑，跑，跑到一个能独自呆着的地方去。

　　礼毕！在他的脑子里不断重复着老米西玛的这句话。礼毕，礼毕……他爱过的季雅纪美，静静地、远远地，但亦是强烈地，义无反顾地，不带任何奢望地爱着她。可现在，一切都已经“礼毕”了。在他十六岁那年。

　　在月圆的夜晚，羚羊圣堂内，无数的秘密被倾诉了，完成了，或诞生了。走进羚羊圣堂时还是孩子，出来时就能成为真正的男子汉。男孩们个个又害怕又期待。而那一天终于到了。

　　太阳已谢幕退下，月亮露出脸来，他跟几个人一同到了那儿。夜幕中，依稀能看见几个男人站在圣堂门口，梯子下面有红色的光。带头的几个男孩已经开始往下爬，一个男人突然走过来，抓住他的胳臂，把他拖出了队伍。他奋力地挣脱，躲躲闪闪地回到方才的位置。但这一次，那人打了他，扯住他的头发说：“你可没有资格参加，白毛！你这狗娘养的小杂种！”男孩们全都大笑起来。“滚！”可他还是在人群旁徘徊。“滚！”人们嚎叫道。还有人捡石头扔他。“滚，滚，滚！”一阵飞石朝他袭来。他被砸得浑身冒血，不得不跑开，躲进了暗处。随着最后一个男孩爬下梯子，那红灯闪耀的圣堂里响起了歌声，只有他被留在寂寞里。

　　他彻底地孤苦无依了，只身被留在村外光秃秃的台地上。月光照耀下的岩石像是褪了色的骷髅，山谷里有郊狼在对月而嚎。伤口很疼，还在流血，但他的眼泪却并非因为痛楚，而是因为孤独。只有他被赶了出来，被赶进了这个月光和岩石的骷髅世界。他在悬崖边上背着月光坐了下来，低头一片漆黑，他看到了死亡的影子。只要向前一步，轻轻一跳……他把右手伸进月光里，手腕上的伤口还在渗血，几秒钟一滴，黑色的，在死亡的月色下失去了颜色。一滴，一滴，又一滴。明天，明天，还有明天……。

　　他发现了时间、死亡以及上帝。

　　“孤独，一直都感到孤独。”小伙子说。

　　这话在贝尔纳心中激起悲切的共鸣。孤独，孤独……“我也是，”内心油然而生一种想要倾诉的欲望，“孤独得可怕。”

　　“你也会孤独吗？”约翰显然对此感到惊讶，“我还以为在‘那个地方’……琳达总是跟我说，‘那个地方’的人从来不会孤独。”

　　贝尔纳的脸“刷”的一下红了。“事实上，”他咕哝道，尴尬地转移开了视线，“我觉得自己跟大部分的人都不太一样。如果一个人换瓶时就跟别人不同，那自然……”

　　“对，就是这么回事。”小伙子点点头，“跟别人不一样就势必会孤独。人们对与众不同的人很无情。你知道吗？他们完全把我排挤到一个孤立的世界里。当其他年轻人都去山上过夜时——这是我们梦想守护兽的仪式——他们不准我跟去；也不肯告诉我任何秘密。虽然如此，我还是自己去了。”他补充道。“整整五天没有吃东西，然后某天晚上，我一个人去了那边的山上。”他指了指远处。

　　贝尔纳不以为然地笑了笑，“你梦到什么了吗？”他问。

　　他点了点头。“是的，但是我不能告诉你。”他沉默了一会儿，用低沉的嗓音说，“我曾经做过一件其他人从未做过的事：那是某天中午，炎热的夏天，我靠在一块岩石上，向两侧举起双臂，和耶稣被钉在十字架上的姿势一样。”

　　“那是要干什么？”

　　“我想知道被钉在十字架上承受暴晒是什么滋味……”。

　　“啊？为什么？”

　　“为什么？嗯……”他沉思了片刻，“因为我觉得应该这么做。既然耶稣能够承受这痛苦，我也应该做得到。再说，如果做错了什么事，就需要……还有一个原因，就是我不快乐。”

　　“真有趣，你用这种方法治好你的不快乐？”贝尔纳说。可他转念一想，也并非毫无道理，不管怎么说，总比依靠唆麻强……

　　“不一会儿我就晕倒了，”小伙子说。“脸朝下倒在了地上。你看见我当时留下的伤口了吗？”他撩起额头上一撮浓密的金发，露出了右太阳穴上的伤疤，一道灰白的褶痕。

　　看到伤疤，贝尔纳微微一震，迅速把脸撇开。条件设置让他对这种场面感到格外反感，而不是心生同情。只要提起疾病或者伤痛，他就会感觉毛骨悚然，甚至难受恶心，像见到什么污秽、残缺或是衰老的东西似的。他赶忙移转话题。

　　“你愿意跟我们一起回伦敦吗？”他问道，跨出了战争的第一步。自从在小房间里意识到野蛮人“父亲”的身份后，他就开始秘密地策划这个战略，“你想去吗？”

　　小伙子脸上流露出惊喜的神采。“你说的是真的吗？”

　　“当然，如果我能得到批准就没问题。”

　　“琳达也会去吧？”

　　“嗯……”他犹豫斟酌了一番。带那个恶心的怪物回去！不，绝对不行。除非，除非……突然，贝尔纳灵机一动，觉得她那丑恶的模样可能正是一个巨大的筹码。“那是当然！”他大声喊出来，一改他起初的迟疑，热情得过了火。

　　小伙子深深地吸了一口气。“真不敢相信梦想这么快就能实现，这可是我平生的梦想啊！你还记得米兰达说过的话吗？”

　　“米兰达是谁？”

　　显然，小伙子没有听到提问，而是动情地说，“啊，奇迹！”眼睛闪耀着光辉，面颊焕发出光彩。“那儿有多么美妙的生灵啊！人类多么善良！”他脸上泛起越来越深的红晕。他想到了列宁娜，一个穿深绿色粘胶衣裳的天使，花样的年华和肌肤保养品使她显得光彩照人，加之那丰腴的身材和友善的微笑……他的声音激动地颤抖。“啊，美妙的新世界！”他突然停了下来，面颊的血色褪去，苍白得像张白纸。

　　“你跟她结婚了吗？”他问。

　　“我跟她什么？”

　　“结婚。用印第安话说就是：永远的结合，从此再也不分离。”

　　“哦，弗德！没有这种事。”贝尔纳忍不住笑了。

　　约翰也笑了，但和贝尔纳的笑不同，他是打心眼里的高兴。

　　“啊，美妙的新世界，”他重复着诗颂，“有那么多出色的人！我们马上启程吧。”

　　“有时候你讲话的方式很特别。”贝尔纳用一种迷惑而惊奇的眼神打量着小伙子，“再说，还是等到你真正看见新世界后再下结论吧。”

第17章


　　经历了一整天的离奇与恐惧，列宁娜感觉自己迫切地需要来一次完整而绝对的唆麻假期。一回房间，她就马上吞下了六克半的唆麻。躺上床，十分钟不到，列宁娜已经飘向了月亮的永恒里，估计到她醒来至少还得等上十八个小时。

　　与此同时，在一片黑暗里，贝尔纳正瞪着眼睛，躺在床上思考，一直到凌晨时分才坠入梦乡。不过，这回的失眠可不是一无所获，一项计划在他心中悄悄地成形了。

　　第二天早上十点，飞机准时降落，穿绿色制服的混血儿走了出来，贝尔纳在龙舌兰丛中等着他。

　　“克朗小姐在享受她的‘唆麻假期’，”他解释道，“五点以前是不会醒来了。所以，我们有七个小时的时间。”

　　从现在到她醒来的这段间隙，足够贝尔纳先飞到圣塔菲办事，然后再飞回马尔佩斯。时间十分充裕。

　　“她在这儿不会有任何危险，对吗？”

　　“不会，我保证，就跟躺在直升飞机里一样安全。”混血儿说道。

　　两人登上飞机随即出发了。十点三十四分，降落在圣塔菲邮局的楼顶；十点三十七分，贝尔纳接通白厅世界总统办公室的电话；十点三十九分，他与总统阁下的四秘交谈；十点四十四分，他向总统办一秘重述本次电话的初衷；十点四十七分半，电话里传来一个深沉而洪亮的声音，那便是穆斯塔法·孟德总统阁下本人。

　　“我冒昧地认为，总统阁下您会发现这件事情的学术价值，它将震撼整个科学界……”贝尔纳结结巴巴地结束了这段讲话。

　　“是的，我的确这么认为。那么，你把他们带回伦敦吧。”

　　“这样的话，总统阁下，我可能需要一张特别许可证……”

　　“目前我们已经向保留地总督传达相关指令，你现在出发前往他的官邸便可。再见，马克斯先生。”

　　电话里突然一片寂静。贝尔纳放下话筒，匆匆赶到楼顶停机坪。

　　“去总督官邸。”他对伽玛绿混血儿说。

　　十点五十四分，贝尔纳和总督握手。

　　“很荣幸，马克斯先生，很荣幸。”他的大嗓门里透着股尊敬的意味，“我们刚刚才收到总统办公室的特别指令……”

　　“我知道，”贝尔纳打断了他，“我与总统阁下的电话刚刚才结束。”那厌倦的语气暗示着这个人已习惯了与总统阁下的电话交谈，每周七天一天也不落。贝尔纳倒在椅子上，“麻烦你尽快采取所有的必要措施，一定要尽快。”他重复了好几遍“尽快”以示强调，完全沉浸在一种自我欣赏的陶醉氛围里。

　　十一点零三分，他的口袋里已经装进了所有需要的文件。

　　“再见。”在电梯口，贝尔纳向送他的总督道别，语气里透露着自以为高人一等的味道。“再见。”

　　他步行回到招待所，洗了澡，按了摩，剃了胡子，听了早间新闻，看了半小时电视，再从容地享用了午餐，下午两点半才同混血儿一道飞回了马尔佩斯。

　　小伙子站在招待所门外。

　　“贝尔纳，贝尔纳！”他喊道，可是没有人回答。

　　他穿着双鹿皮靴，步履轻盈安静。跑上台阶，拽了拽门，门锁了。

　　他们走了！真的走了！这是他年轻生命里发生过的最糟糕的事情。列宁娜邀请他来，可是，他们居然走了。小伙子坐在台阶上，难过得哭了起来。

　　半小时后，他突然想起可以透过窗子看看里面是什么情况。第一眼他就瞄到了一只绿色的手提箱，盖子上印着两个大写字母l．c，那是主人的姓名缩写。一种欢愉在他心里像火一样地燃烧了起来。他拣起一块石头，“啪”的一声把玻璃砸碎，玻璃碎片叮叮锵锵地落到地上。片刻之后他走进屋，打开绿色的手提箱，一种香气弥漫了出来。那是列宁娜的香水味，那芬芳，是她的体香，径直沁入了他的心脾。心脏发狂地跳了起来，有那么一瞬间，他感觉似乎要晕厥过去。他俯下身，凝望着这个珍贵的绿箱子，小心翼翼地轻抚一番后，将它移到了光亮处检视。乍一看，列宁娜那条人造棉绒短裤上的拉链让他有些摸不着头脑，不过琢磨透之后，他便发现那很有意思：拉过来，拉过去，再拉过来，又拉过去……他上瘾了。箱子里还有一双列宁娜的绿色拖鞋，这是他头一回见到如此精致的玩意儿。欣赏完拖鞋，他打开了一件带拉链的连体束身内衣，明白这东西的用途，他羞红了脸，赶紧放回了原处。接着，他翻出了一条人造丝手绢，亲吻了一下，又把另外一条围巾戴到了脖子上。然后他又看到了一个漂亮的小盒子，打开盒子时一股香粉喷了出来，满手都是。他把香粉擦在胸口上，肩膀上，胳膊上。多么怡人的香气啊！他闭上了眼，用脸蹭了蹭还残余着香粉的胳膊。又细又滑，这是他的脸碰到胳膊时的唯一感受。一股麝香的气味钻进了他的鼻孔——这是真正的她。“列宁娜，”他喃喃低语着，“列宁娜！”

　　不知哪里传来的声响让他吓了一跳，心虚地转过身去，急忙将刚才偷偷拿出来的东西全塞回了手提箱，关上了盖子；然后仔细地听了听，看了看。没有人影，也没有声音。可他刚才确实，确实是听见了什么声音。那声音像是人在叹气，又像是木板发出的咯吱声。为了一探究竟，他踮起脚尖悄悄地走到门边，谨慎地打开门，发现门外是一处宽阔的平台，对面是另一道虚掩着的门。他穿过去，推开门，偷偷窥视了起来。

　　一张矮床上，列宁娜躺在中间，被子给踢开了。她穿着一件粉红色的拉链睡衣，卷发在头下散开，把面颊衬托得优雅而美丽。粉红色的脚趾，还有睡熟后安稳的神态，都像孩子般地惹人怜爱；柔软的手掌，垂落的胳膊，无助里透出了信任和坦然。这一幅画面让他眼眶里含满了泪水。

　　他费尽心机采取了各种措施不想吵醒熟睡中的列宁娜。其实这一切都没有必要，因为想要让一个人提前结束唆麻假期，除了开枪别无他法。他走进屋子，跪到床边，凝望着那个可人儿。下意识地，他扣紧了双手，嘴唇似乎动了一下，低语着：“她的眼睛。”

　　“你告诉我她是多么的美丽，

　　她的眼睛，她的头发，她的面庞，她的步态，她的语调……

　　一切洁白的东西，和她的玉手一比，

　　都会变成墨水一样黝黑，写下它们自己的罪行；

　　比起她柔荑的一握来，天鹅的绒毛都坚硬无比，……”

　　（莎士比亚 《特洛埃勒斯与克雷雪达》）

　　一只苍蝇嗡嗡地飞进来，绕着列宁娜打圈。他挥手将它赶走，于是又想到“苍蝇”，

　　“污秽的苍蝇都可以接触亲爱的朱丽叶的皎洁的玉手，

　　从她的嘴唇上偷取天堂中的幸福，

　　那两片嘴唇是这样的纯洁贞淑，永远含着娇羞，

　　好像觉得它们自身的相吻也是一种罪恶……”

　　（莎士比亚《罗密欧与朱丽叶》）

　　他迟疑不定地一点点伸过手去，仿佛要抚摸一只羞怯又危险的鸟。在距离列宁娜的手指还有一寸的地方，在即将要碰到想象中那种柔软的时刻，他的手定住了，悬停在空中，不住地颤抖着。他有勇气去碰触吗？他有勇气用自己卑微的手去亵渎吗？不，他没有勇气。这只美丽的鸟太危险。他的手又放了回去。她多么美！多么美！

　　突然，他发现自己在思考：只要顺着列宁娜的脖子轻轻地拉下睡衣拉链……他赶忙闭上眼，使劲摇头，就像落水狗一样来回甩着自己的耳朵。下流的想法！他为自己感到羞愧。“……纯洁贞淑，永远含着娇羞……”

　　空气中再度传来“嗡嗡”的声音：又有苍蝇想偷取天堂中的幸福吗？难道是黄蜂？他四处张望，什么都没有。可那声音并未消失，反而渐响，离窗户越来越近。是飞机！他惊慌失措地站起来，迅速钻进另一间房，从窗口跳出去，直奔那条位于高大的龙舌兰丛间的小径。在树丛间奋力奔跑时，他看见了从直升飞机上走下来的贝尔纳。

第18章


　　四千个房间里，四千座电钟的指针齐齐指向了两点二十七分。这是在布鲁姆斯伯里中心，也就是主任口中的“蜂巢工厂”。工人们像勤劳的蜜蜂“嗡嗡”地忙碌着，每个人都各司其职、有条不紊地工作。显微镜下，精子兴奋地甩着长尾巴，争前恐后地往卵子里钻。受精后，卵子渐渐膨胀、分裂。经过波卡化的卵子则会出芽并分裂成一大群各自独立的胚胎。命运设定室通过隆隆作响的自动扶梯驶进地下室。暗红的灯光下，胎儿躺在冒着热气的腹膜垫上，贪婪地摄入代血浆和荷尔蒙，一点一点地长大。部分胎儿根据设定接受毒素，生长进程和速度被压抑，继而发育成矮小愚钝的伊普西龙。瓶架发出细微的嗡鸣声和咔哒声，那是新生命在艰难而缓慢的蠕动，一周又一周，仿佛永恒一般漫长。直到成熟的那一天，新生儿们在换瓶室里发出人生中第一声惊恐而好奇的尖叫。

　　地下室再下面一层，发电机轰隆隆地响着，电梯快速地升降。整整十一个楼层的育婴室里安置着一千八百个婴儿，他们身上都小心地贴好了标签。哺乳时间到了，婴儿们像接受到指令，同时从一千八百个奶瓶里吮吸起巴氏消毒过的外分泌液体，分量是一品脱。

　　育婴室往上的十个楼层都是宿舍。尚年幼的男童和女童还需要午睡，但是他们实际上并不比其他人清闲。他们并没有意识到，自己在睡梦中也在孜孜不倦地学习：他们听着睡眠教学中的各类课程，涉及卫生保健、社会交际、阶级意识以及儿童爱情生活。再往上走便是幼童娱乐室，这会儿天气转变为下雨，九百个稍微年长的儿童兴趣盎然地堆积木，捏橡胶泥，还有的在玩“找拉链”和性爱游戏。

　　“蜂巢”的嗡嗡声歌唱着忙碌而欢快的生活。姑娘们照料试管之余无忧无虑地哼歌，命运设定工边工作边吹口哨。换瓶室的空瓶上方，工人们谈笑风生，好不快活！然而，与亨利·福斯特一起进入受精室的主任却是一脸严肃，皮肤绷紧得像木头。

　　“这个车间是社会的榜样和模范。”主任说。“要知道，这屋里的高种姓人员比中心的其他任何部门都多。我让他两点半来这里见我。”

　　“他的工作表现还不赖。”亨利虚伪地表现自己的宽容和公正。

　　“这我承认，但正因如此更应该严格要求他。拥有过人的才智，就必须受到更多道德责任的约束。想想看，越有本事的人就越有能力煽动他人走上邪路。与其让大伙都被影响和玷污，不如让一个人吃点苦。福斯特先生，抛开感情因素考虑这个问题，你会明白，一切过错都不像异端思想那么不可原谅。杀人犯只不过能毁灭个别人的生命，而个别人的生命有什么价值？”他扬起手臂指了指一排排显微镜、试管和培育器。“创造生命是轻而易举的事，只要我们愿意，想造多少就造多少。可是，离经叛道的行为不仅仅威胁个别人的生命，更能严重打击整个社会。对，受害者是整个社会。”他再次强调。“啊，正好来了。”

　　贝尔纳走进屋，在一排排授精员的空隙中向他们走来。他摆出一副毫无顾虑、自信满满的表情，以掩饰心中的紧张不安。“早上好，主任。”他问好的声调高得有些滑稽，为了弥补这个失误，他补充道：“你要我来这里跟你谈一谈。”可这次的声音却柔和得离谱，像老鼠吱吱叫。

　　“对，马克斯先生。”主任神情倨傲地说，“我的确要求你来见我。我知道你度完假回来了，昨天晚上到的。”

　　“是。”贝尔纳回答。

　　“是——是。”主任拉长尾音重复了一次，像蛇一样发出嘶嘶的声音。随即张大嗓门说，“女士们，先生们，”声音像小号一样嘹亮激昂，“女士们，先生们。”

　　姑娘们的歌声和显微镜操作员的口哨声戛然而止，房间忽然静得可怕，所有人都疑惑地环顾四周。

　　“女士们，先生们，”主任再次重复道，“很抱歉打断了各位的辛勤劳动。我肩负着沉重的社会责任，所以必须做出一个痛苦的决定。因为，我们社会的安全和稳定岌岌可危。是的，岌岌可危！女士们，先生们。”他指着贝尔纳愤愤地说，“现在站在你们面前的这个阿尔法加，接受了许许多多的社会福利，本应该为集体做出卓越的贡献。然而，你们这位同事——我还是提前称呼他为‘前同事’吧——无耻地辜负了大伙对他的信任。他对娱乐活动和唆麻的看法严重违背社会纲常；他无视正统性爱观，过着为人不齿的性生活；他拒绝遵循我主弗德的教诲，常常违反‘下班后保持婴儿状态’的原则（主任边说边比划了一个t字）。这一切都有力地证明他已经成为社会的敌人，成为秩序和稳定的颠覆者，成为文明的背叛者。女士们，先生们，出于上述原因，我严正提议开除他，撤销他在本中心的职务，让他声名狼藉。我建议立即向上级请示，把他调到最低层次的下级中心去。为了最大限度地维护社会利益，最好加重惩罚，把他送到远离文明核心的地方去，越远越好。到了冰岛，他就穷途末路了，再也不能煽动他人背叛光明的弗德。”主任停下来，双手交叉在胸前，盛气凌人地转向贝尔纳。“马克斯，”他说道，“对于我给你的处分，你有什么疑义吗？”

　　“我有。”贝尔纳的声音特别响亮。

　　这反应让主任有些吃惊，不过他依然保持了上级的威严：“请说。”

　　“当然我会说的。只是，不是现在。我的理由马上就出现，请各位稍安勿躁。”贝尔纳跑到门边，用力将门打开，向外头的什么东西命令道：“进来。”贝尔纳口中的“理由”终于出现在了大家面前。

　　抽气声此起彼伏，显然所有人都被吓倒了，惊讶和恐惧使屋子里响起了阵阵私语。一个年轻的姑娘开始尖叫；另一个人因为距离太远看不真切，于是站上椅子，却不慎打翻了两根精子试管。引起轰动的是一个肥胖松垂的身影，那是走进来的琳达。在这群人的青春躯体和精致面庞的衬托下，她成了突兀可怕的中年妖怪。虽然她努力地想让脸上的微笑多一些风情，可一切只是徒劳，那微笑依然破碎而苍白。走路时她摆动着腰肢自忖性感迷人，却不知那过于硕大的臀部上下翻动，十足令人倒胃。贝尔纳一直跟在她的旁边。

　　“就是他。”贝尔纳指着主任。

　　“难道你认为我会认不出他？”琳达愤愤不平道，然后转过身面朝主任，“我当然认得出你，托马金。不管你在哪儿，即便你混在一千个人里面，我也能一眼认出你来。不过，你可能把我给忘了。你记得吗？记得我吗，托马金？我可是你的琳达。”她站在那儿凝望着他，头歪向一边，脸上仍然带着微笑。不过在主任脸上分明的僵硬与厌恶前，那微笑越来越不坚定，开始动摇，最后全部消失。“难道你当真记不起来了，托马金？”她重复道，语带颤抖，眼神里充满了焦躁和痛苦。那张长斑下垂的老脸慢慢扭曲，变成了一副悲痛欲绝的怪相，很有些滑稽。“托马金！”她伸出双臂深情唤道。人群中传出了窃笑。

　　“这是在干吗？”主任问道，“这个丑陋的……”

　　“托马金！”她向前跑来，拖着毛毡，甩出手臂搂住他的脖子，最后把脸埋进了他的胸膛。

　　哄堂大笑。

　　“……这种下流的恶作剧太卑鄙了！”主任大吼道。

　　满脸通红的主任试图挣脱，却被死死地搂住。“我是琳达，我是琳达。”她的话语被满室的笑声盖过。“你让我怀了个孩子！”她终于尖叫道，现场的骚动一下子消失了，取而代之的是一种可怕的寂静；每个人的目光都游移不定，不知该停在哪儿。主任脸上一片苍白。他突然忘记了挣扎，静静站着，抓着琳达的手腕，低头盯着她，整个人都呆滞了。“是的，一个孩子，我就是他的母亲。”她有些故意地把这个粗俗词汇扔进了满室的寂静里，像在接受某种挑战一样。然后她猛地推开了主任，双手掩面，羞耻地哭了起来。“不是我的错，托马金。我从来不会忘记做操，你记得吗？是不是？从来不忘……我不知道怎么会……你能想象那有多么恐怖吗？托马金……但儿子对我也是种安慰。”她转身对着门外喊道，“约翰！约翰！”

　　约翰在门口往里看了一圈，踏着鹿皮靴安静地穿过房间，迅速来到了主任身前。他“扑通”一声跪下，清楚地叫了声：“父亲！”

　　这个可笑的下流字眼却意外地缓和了屋子里的紧张。（因为“父亲”的言外之意与生育并无太多关联之处，没有道德上的堕落感，也就没那么令人憎恶。可以说，这个词粗俗却还不至于淫秽。）这一回爆发的哄堂大笑近乎到了歇斯底里的程度。不间断的笑声让人不禁开始怀疑它是否有结束的时候。父亲——主任！主任——父亲！我主弗德！这一幕简直太精彩了！喧闹声、哄笑声，一波接着一波，嘴都快笑裂了，眼泪已经笑了出来。又有六支精子试管被打翻了。

　　“我的父亲！”

　　主任脸色惨白，神色几近疯狂。他怒气冲冲地瞪着约翰，内心却感受到一种被羞辱的痛苦。

　　“我的父亲！”渐渐平静的人群因为这句话又爆出满堂笑声，甚至比之前还要喧闹。主任捂住耳朵冲出了房间。

第19章 (1)


　　受精室“神奇一幕”后，伦敦简直热开了锅，高等种姓都急不可待地想看看这个奇妙的野蛮人：他居然给培育与条件设置中心主任下跪了。或者应该说前主任，因为这可怜人随后就辞了职，从此再没有踏入中心半步。野蛮人“扑通”一声跪在他面前叫“父亲”，这个笑话简直精彩得难以置信！琳达倒是没有引起轰动；没有人对她感兴趣。称呼一个人为妈妈，已经远远超过了恶作剧的底线，是绝对的亵渎。况且，她并不是一个真正意义上的野蛮人，像其他人一样，她从瓶里培育出来，然后接受条件设置，不会有什么异于常人的稀奇想法。但说到底，人们不愿意去看琳达的最大原因在于她糟糕透顶的外形：肥胖臃肿，毫无青春气息，满口七零八落的坏牙，晦暗的皮肤上布满斑点。更别提那身材了，天哪！你看到她一定觉得反胃。聪明人是坚决不会去见琳达的。而琳达自己呢，也没有兴趣去见那些人。对她来说，得到唆麻就像是回归到文明，只想终日躺在床上，度过一个又一个假期，不用忍受头疼和呕吐带来的煎熬，也不会像喝了佩瑶特后那样难受：仿佛犯下了大逆不道的罪行，耻辱得再也抬不起头。唆麻不会带来任何不适，它给予的假期绝妙无双。如果假期过后的那个早晨感到低落，也不是真正的感觉，而是相比之下不像唆麻假期中那样逍遥自在罢了。缓解低落的办法就是延续唆麻假期。琳达贪而无厌地要求加大剂量，而且服用得越来越频繁。肖医生起初不赞同，最后还是满足了她的要求，她每天的服用量居然多达20克。

　　“这样下去，她最多还能活两个月。”医生向贝尔纳吐露实情，“终有一天，她的呼吸系统会瘫痪，直到停止呼吸死亡。这倒也不是坏事。如果我们能返老还童，谁都愿意重获青春。可惜我们做不到。”

　　当所有人都对琳达的唆麻假期毫无异议时，约翰出乎意料地提出反对。

　　“给她这么大剂量的唆麻，不是要缩短她的寿命么？”

　　“某种意义上来说，是这样，”肖医生承认，“但是换个角度来看，我们是在延长她的寿命。”小伙子疑惑不解地盯着他。“唆麻确实会减短几年寿命，”医生继续说，“但是想想看，它超越现实时间带来的岁月的延续，长到无法计算。每一个唆麻假期，都是我们祖先口中的永恒。”

　　约翰慢慢明白了。“原来永恒只在口中和眼里。”他嘀咕着。

　　“你说什么？”

　　“没什么。”

　　肖医生继续说：“对于那些有重要工作的人，我们当然不能让他们随意离开到永恒去。可琳达并没有任何重要工作，不是么？”

　　“尽管如此，”约翰坚持地说，“我还是反对这么做。”

　　医生耸了耸肩。“好吧，也许你希望听她一直疯狂地尖叫……”

　　最后，约翰不得不让步。琳达如愿得到了唆麻。从那以后，她再也没出过三十七楼贝尔纳公寓的小屋，终日躺在床上，永远开着收音机和电视机，广藿香油不停的滴着，唆麻药片放在触手可及的范围内——她的肉体呆在那里，可灵魂仿佛早已经神游到渺远的地方，一个虚无的异世界。在那里，收音机里的音乐像是一个奇妙多彩、惊险刺激的迷宫，曲折蜿蜒地通向绝对信仰的中心；在那里，电视机中舞动的身影美轮美奂，演员们的歌声悠扬迷人；在那里，天竺薄荷尤为芬芳，那感觉像太阳，像百万支萨克斯管合奏，更像是和波佩做爱时的愉悦，甚至比那还要美妙，美妙得无可比拟，没有尽头。

　　“确实，我们做不到返老还童。”肖医生总结道，“但有机会看到人类衰老的样本真是一件乐事。感谢你让我过来。”他热情地跟贝尔纳握手。

　　从那以后，约翰成为了唯一的关注焦点。人们只有通过他的正式监护人贝尔纳，才能与约翰会面。贝尔纳现在发现，自己不仅生平以来首次受到正常对待，还成为了至关重要的大人物。再也没有人说他的血液替代品是酒精了，也再也没人嘲笑他的外貌。亨利·福斯特也罕见地对他示好；贝尼托·胡佛送给他六盒性激素口香糖作为礼物。命运预订助理为了能参加贝尔纳举办的晚宴，不惜卑躬屈膝请求邀请函。至于那些女人们，只要得到贝尔纳邀约的暗示，就争相投入他的怀抱。

　　“我收到贝尔纳的邀请了，下周三和野蛮人见面。”法妮带着胜利的口吻宣布。

　　“我太高兴了，”列宁娜说，“现在你得承认之前错看了贝尔纳。他其实很可爱，不是么？”

　　法妮点点头。“我还得承认，我为此感到很惊喜。”

　　装瓶主任、命运预测总督、受精指挥官的三个副助理、情感工程学院的感官教授、威斯敏斯特社区合唱团负责人、波卡化主管……总之，贝尔纳的贵宾名单没完没了。

　　“我上周得手了六个姑娘，”他向亥姆霍兹·沃森透露，“星期一一个，星期二两个，星期五又两个，星期六一个。如果我有更多时间，或者更有兴趣的话，至少还有十来个姑娘排着队等着……”

　　听着他自吹自擂，亥姆霍兹只是阴着脸沉默不语，这让贝尔纳很生气。

　　“你嫉妒我”，他说。

　　亥姆霍兹摇了摇头，“我只是有点悲伤”，他回答说。

　　贝尔纳气呼呼地走了。他对自己说，以后再也不和亥姆霍兹说话了，再也不。

　　时光一天天流逝，成功冲昏了贝尔纳的头脑。他就像喝了一杯醉人的美酒，与那个他曾经不满的世界一笔勾销了冤仇。只要他被当做重要人物，一切秩序就都是美好的。但是，尽管他个人的成功使他与社会秩序和解了，他不会放弃批判社会的特权。因为批判这种行为让他感到自己更加重要和伟大。况且，他是真的认为有些事情值得批判（同时，他也真的很喜欢做一个风云人物，拥有美丽的姑娘）。在那些为了野蛮人而向他谄媚的人面前，贝尔纳总是摆出一副吹毛求疵、离经叛道的模样。人们当他面只是礼貌地听着，背后都摇着头说：“那小子最后总会倒霉的。”他们议论纷纷，充满信心地预言自己早晚会见到贝尔纳的悲惨下场。“到那时，再也没有第二个野蛮人来帮助他了。”话虽这么说，只要第一个野蛮人还在那，他们就得保持表面的客气。如此一来，贝尔纳越发觉得自己特别伟大，快活得飘飘然，简直飞上了云层。

　　“快活地飞上云层。”贝尔纳指着天空说。

　　如同天空中的一颗珍珠，气象部门的探测气球高高飘着，在阳光中闪烁着玫瑰色的光芒。

　　“……向所谓的野蛮人，”贝尔纳指点地说，“展示了文明生活的各个方面……”

　　现在向野蛮人展示的是现代文明生活的鸟瞰图：从切林t字形塔楼上俯视的景象。站长和气象学专家为他做向导，贝尔纳却滔滔不绝，他极其兴奋，表现得像一个正在参观的世界总统。他又飘飘然了。

　　从孟买来的绿色火箭从空中降落，乘客们走了出来，乘务员从八个舷窗往外看着——是八个一模一样的达罗毗荼多生子，穿着卡其色制服。

　　“每小时一千二百五十公里，”站长不无自豪地说，“野蛮人先生，你觉得如何？”

　　约翰觉得挺不错。“不过，”他说，“埃里厄尔四十分钟就能绕地球一圈。”

　　“野蛮人，”贝尔纳在给穆斯塔法·孟德的报告中这样写道，“对文明社会的各种发明一点儿也不感到惊奇或是敬畏。当然，有部分原因在于一个叫琳达的女人讲述过这些。琳达是他的母……”

　　（穆斯塔法·孟德皱了皱眉，“这个蠢家伙难道以为我就如此脆弱，连看到完整的‘母亲’一词都受不了么？”）

　　“另外，他的注意力集中在一种被他称作‘灵魂’的东西上，他坚称那是一种脱离物质环境而独立存在的实体。然而，我试图向他解释……”

　　总统快速掠过后面的几段，正想翻页找出一些更具体有趣的内容，忽然，他的目光被一连串不同寻常的话吸引住了。“……但是我必须承认，”他读出声来，“在这点上我和野蛮人意见一致。那就是，文明时代的婴幼儿时期确实过于简单，就像他说的，不够昂贵。我想借此机会，向阁下建议……”

　　一瞬间的愤怒后，穆斯塔法·孟德猛地大笑起来。这家伙竟然一本正经地给总统上起课来了，还说什么社会秩序过于荒诞不经，他是疯了吗？“我得给他点儿教训，”他自言自语道，然后仰头大笑了起来。但就目前而言，还没有教训他的必要。

　　他们来到一个生产直升飞机灯具的小工厂，是电力设备公司的分公司，在屋顶见到了前来接待的技术主管和人事经理（总统的推荐信具有奇效）。他们走下楼梯，进入工厂。

　　“每一个环节，”人事经理解释着，“都尽可能由一个单独的波卡小组负责。”

　　实际上，八十三个圆头圆脑，黑皮肤，几乎看不见鼻子的德尔塔人负责冷压缩；五十六个姜黄皮肤，鹰钩鼻的伽玛人熟练操作着五十六个四轴车床；一百零七个被设置为耐高温的塞内加尔伊普西龙人在铸造车间工作；三十三个茶色皮肤，长脸，窄盆骨，身高一米六九（误差不超过二十毫米）的德尔塔女人负责拧螺丝钉。集装室内，两组伽玛加侏儒把发电机都归集到一起。两张矮工作台面对面的放着，中间的传送带上正传送着零件；四十七个金发白肤的工人面对着四十七个棕发工人；四十七个塌鼻子的工人对着四十七个鹰钩鼻的工人；四十七个下巴后缩的工人对着四十七个下巴突出的工人。完成的机件由十八个长得一模一样的伽玛女孩儿检查，她们留着棕色卷发，身着绿色制服。然后由三十四个短腿的左撇子德尔塔打包装箱，再由六十三个亚麻色头发、蓝眼睛、长雀斑的伊普西龙傻子搬运到等候的货车上去。

　　“啊，美妙的新世界……”记忆仿佛在恶意地开玩笑：野蛮人发现自己正背诵着米兰达的诗颂，“美妙的新世界，有这样的人在里头！”

　　“我向你保证，”当他们离开工厂的时候，人事经理总结道，“我们的工人从来不惹事。我们总是发现……”

　　野蛮人突然离开那些陪同参观的人，到灌木丛后剧烈地干呕起来，仿佛坚实的大地变成陷入大气漩涡中的直升飞机般颠簸摇晃。

　　“野蛮人，”贝尔纳写道，“不愿服用唆麻，而且因为他的母……琳达一直处在唆麻假日中，显得特别悲伤。有一点很有趣，尽管他母……的衰老状态和丑陋外貌极其令人厌恶，野蛮人还是频繁地看望她，并且流露出深刻的依恋之情——这例子很有意思，说明了早期条件设置可以改变甚至战胜天然冲动（此例中为躲避丑恶事物的冲动）。”

　　他们降落在伊顿公学的屋顶上。学校操场的对面，五十二层高的卢普顿大楼在阳光的照耀下闪着白光。左边是一间大学，右边是学校社区合唱厅，安装着庄重的钢铁架构和维他玻璃。在广场的正中央，矗立着一尊铬钢制作的，古色古香的弗德像。

　　下飞机后，学院院长加夫尼博士和女主任济慈小姐接待了他们。

　　“这里也有很多多生子吗？”参观开始前，野蛮人忐忑不安地问。

　　“不多，”院长回答，“伊顿只接收上层阶级家庭的孩子们。一卵只能长成一个成年人。当然，这让教育变得尤为困难。但是，我们没得选择，他们将来是要身负重任的，还要处理突发事件。”他叹着气说。

　　与此同时，贝尔纳已经对济慈小姐浮想联翩。“如果你哪个周一，周三或周五晚上有空的话……”他边说边用手指戳了野蛮人一下，“你知道，他很古怪，”贝尔纳又加了一句，“怪得很稀奇。”

　　济慈小姐笑了（这笑容在他眼里着实迷人），说了句谢谢，并表示愿意去参加他的晚宴。这时，院长打开了一扇门。

　　在阿尔法双加教室里，约翰度过了迷惑不解的五分钟。

　　“基本相对论是什么？”他小声问贝尔纳。贝尔纳试图解释一下，但马上改变了主意，建议他们先去别的教室看看。

　　在走廊上，能听到贝塔减地理教室门后一个洪亮的女高音在叫喊，“一、二、三、四，跟着我做。”声音中带着疲倦和焦躁。

　　“这是马尔萨斯体操，”女主任解释着，“当然，我们这里大部分女孩儿都不能生育，我自己就是。”她对贝尔纳一笑，“但是我们还有大约八百个未绝育的女孩儿，她们需要定时做操。”

第20章 (2)


　　在贝塔减地理教室，约翰了解到：蛮族保留地是不值得去耗费精力文明化的地区：那里气候和地理条件恶劣，或者自然资源匮乏。“咔哒”一声，百叶窗关上了，房间暗下来；老师头顶的屏幕上，展出了阿科马的忏悔者拜倒在圣女像前的影像。约翰曾听过他们痛哭，在基督十字架和菩公的鹰形图案前忏悔罪过。年轻的伊顿学生们哄堂大笑。忏悔者们依然在痛哭，然后站起身来，脱掉外套，用带有绳结的鞭子一下一下地抽打自己。即使忏悔者们痛哭和呻吟声渐长，但还是被更大的笑声淹没了。

　　“他们为什么要笑？”野蛮人悲痛而困惑地问道。

　　“为什么？”院长向他转过身，露齿而笑，“为什么？因为这的确太好笑了。”

　　在屏幕的微光下，贝尔纳冒险采取了一个行动，要是放在以前，即使在完全漆黑的情况下，他也不敢做。仗着他自以为傲的重要身份，他伸出手臂搂住女主任的腰。柳腰轻摇了下，屈服了。他正想趁机偷偷亲吻她一两下，或者掐她一把，百叶窗“咔哒”一声又打开了。

　　“我们继续参观吧，”济慈小姐边说边向门口走去。

　　过了一会儿后，院长说：“这儿是睡眠学习控制室。”

　　成百上千个合成音乐盒，每个宿舍一个，排列在三面墙边的架子上；第四面墙边的鸽笼式文件柜里是录音带，收录了睡眠学习的课程录音。

　　“把录音带放进这里，”贝尔纳打断了加夫尼博士的话，解释说，“按下这个开关……”

　　“不对，是那边的开关。”院长愠怒着纠正。

　　“好吧，那个开关。录音带就打开了，硒电池将光脉冲转换为声波，然后……”

　　“然后你就能听到了。”加夫尼博士总结。

　　“他们会读莎士比亚的作品么？”他们在去生物化学实验室的半途路过了学校图书馆，野蛮人问道。

　　“当然不”，女主任红着脸说。

　　“我们的图书馆，”加夫尼博士说，“只有参考书。年轻人若是需要消遣娱乐，可以去感官剧院。沉溺于单独的娱乐活动可不是好事。”

　　五辆校车从他们身边的玻璃化公路上驶过，上面载满了孩子，有的在唱歌，有的在安静地拥抱。

　　“这些学生刚从泥沼火葬场回来，”加夫尼博士解释说。此时贝尔纳正偷偷地与女主任定下了特别之夜的约会。“他们从十八个月大时开始接受死亡条件设置。孩子们每周都要花两个早上的时间去医院上课，那里有最好的玩具，接受设置的那些天，他们会得到巧克力奶油点心。他们学着把死亡视为是理所当然的事。”

　　“和其他生理过程一样。”女主任专业地补充道。

　　约会定好了，八点钟在萨伏伊。

　　回伦敦的途中，他们在布伦特弗德的电视公司工厂前停了下来。

　　“你不介意等我一下吧？我去打个电话。”贝尔纳问。

　　野蛮人边等边看着。正好到了早晚换班时间，低等种姓的工人们正在单轨火车站门前排队，大约有七八百个伽玛、德尔塔和伊普西龙男女，却只有十来种不同的面孔和身高。售票员递车票的时候，会顺带递过一个小纸盒。长长的队伍正缓慢地向前蠕动。

　　“那里面是什么？（想起了《威尼斯商人》）那些纸盒里。”野蛮人向刚刚回来的贝尔纳打听。

　　“一天用量的唆麻，”贝尔纳含糊不清地回答。因为他正在咀嚼贝尼托·胡佛送给他的口香糖。“下班后领取，四粒半克药片，星期六能得到六粒。”

　　他亲切地拉着约翰的手臂，向直升机走去。

　　列宁娜欢快地哼唱着走进更衣室。

　　“你看起来挺高兴的。”法妮说。

　　“是啊，高兴得不得了。”她回答，“嘶拉”一声拉开拉链。“半小时前，贝尔纳打来电话。”“嘶拉，嘶拉”！她脱掉了短裤。“他突然邀约，”“嘶拉”！“问我今晚能不能带野蛮人去看感官剧，我得快点儿了。”她匆忙地奔向浴室。

　　“她真幸运！”法妮自言自语着看着列宁娜走远。

　　善良的法妮只是在陈述一个事实，没有丝毫嫉妒的意味。列宁娜确实很幸运，她和贝尔纳共享了野蛮人的盛名。原本不起眼的她立刻反射出时尚的光辉。青年妇女弗德协会的秘书不是已经邀请她做过一次演讲了么？爱美神俱乐部不是已经邀请她去参加年度晚宴了么？她不是已经上感官新闻，有形有声地出现在全球无数人面前了么？

　　显赫人物对她的恭维和关注也让她得意洋洋。文明世界总统的第二秘书曾邀请她共进晚餐和早餐，弗德大法官和坎特伯雷的首席歌唱家分别和她共度了周末，内外分泌公司董事长不停给她打电话，欧洲银行副董事长带她去了一趟多维尔。

　　“感觉妙极了，但是有时我觉得自己像在糊弄人。”她向法妮承认，“因为，大家最想知道的自然是跟野蛮人做爱的感觉。我却只能说我不知道。”她摇了摇头。“大多数人都不相信我。但这是真的。虽然我也不希望是真的，”她悲伤地叹了口气，“他英俊极了，你不觉得么？”

　　“他不是挺喜欢你的吗？”法妮问。

　　“我觉得他对我忽冷忽热。他常常躲着我。我一进屋，他就会出去；从来不碰我；甚至都不看我。但有时我突然转身，会发现他正在盯着我；你知道的，当一个男人爱上你的时候，他会用怎样的眼神看你。”

　　是的，法妮很清楚。

　　“我真想不明白。”列宁娜说。

　　因为想不明白，她更加困惑和失落。

　　“因为我喜欢他。你懂我吧，法妮？”

　　她越来越喜欢他。现在，正好有机会了。她洗完澡，一边给自己身上拍香粉一边想。“啪，啪，啪”——真正的机会。她愉悦的心情化成了歌声。

　　“亲爱的，抱着我直到我心醉；

　　亲吻我直到我情迷；

　　抱着我，亲爱的甜心；

　　爱像唆麻一样美丽。”

　　芳香风琴正在演奏一曲让人心情愉悦、耳目一新的香草狂想曲——百里香、薰衣草、迷迭香、罗勒、桃金娘和龙嵩有节奏的翩翩起舞发出琶音；馨香的旋律经过一系列强烈的变奏融入了龙涎香，然后在檀香木、樟脑、雪松和新割干草的气息中回转（伴随着极其细微的不和谐的杂音——少许猪腰布丁和猪粪的气味），慢慢地变回最初淳朴的香气。尾音的百里香芬芳逐渐消失时，掌声响起，满堂喝彩，灯光也全都亮了起来。音乐合成音箱里的录音带开始播放。高音小提琴、超级大提琴和交替双簧管的三重奏让整个空气中都充满了惬意慵懒的氛围。三四十个小节之后，一个远远超过于人声的天籁之音开始婉转歌唱，配合着乐器旋律，时而发喉音，时而发头音，时而如笛声绕梁不绝，时而满载着和谐与渴望，毫不费力地从加斯帕德·福斯特破纪录的低音升到了极高的海豚音，比高音c调还高很多——这种具有穿透力的高音，在历史上众多的歌唱家中，只有卢克瑞嘉·阿胡加里唱出过。那是1770年，在帕尔马公爵歌剧院里的演唱，连莫扎特也为之震惊。

　　列宁娜和野蛮人陷在他们的充气座椅中，边嗅边听。接下来是运用眼睛和皮肤的时候了。

　　灯光熄灭，黑暗中漂浮着火焰般闪耀的大字：立体感观剧——《直升机里的三星期》，环绕立体声，合成对话，鲜艳多彩的立体画面，芳香风琴同步伴奏。

　　“紧握住你椅子扶手上的金属球形把手，”列宁娜低声说，“否则就体会不到感官效果了。”

　　野蛮人按她说的做了。

　　火焰般的字母消失了，音乐厅完全暗下来。十秒钟后，炫彩夺目、天下无双的画面突然出现：一个身形巨大的黑人和一个金发短头颅贝塔减女人互相搂抱着，这比现实生活中的血肉之躯还要真实得多，漂亮得多。

　　野蛮人开始发现嘴唇上异样的感觉。他摸了摸嘴，酥麻的感觉缓解了，手一放回金属把手上，又开始酥麻。芳香风琴似乎在演奏纯净的麝香味道。录音带上，那合成的声音，像是一只奄奄一息的超级鸽子，发出“哦——哦——”的声音，每秒钟只颤动三十二次。一个比非洲贝斯还要低的声音唱和着“啊——啊——”，“哦——啊！哦——啊！”屏幕上立体的男人女人再次亲吻起来。豪华宫殿般的剧院中，六千个观众脸部的敏感地带都像通过电流般酥麻，快感和刺激几乎让人无法承受，“哦……”

　　故事情节非常简单。第一声“哦啊”过后几分钟后（伴随着一段二重奏，两个男女在价值连城的熊皮上激情地做爱——命运预测师助理说得太对了，每一根头发都如此的清晰可感），黑人遭遇了直升机事故，头朝下栽下去。“砰！”额头上传来剧痛，观众席不禁发出“哎哟”的声音。

　　头部碰撞完全改变了黑人的条件设置。他对金发碧眼的贝塔女人产生了一种近乎发狂的独特热情。女人抗拒，但黑人还是坚持，挣扎，追求，攻击情敌，最后还惊心动魄地绑架了女人。金发贝塔被迷昏带到了天上，与黑人疯子单独在一起，整整三天都在听他讲反社会的无耻言论。最后，经历了一系列的冒险和空中的翻滚打斗，三个年轻英俊的阿尔法成功解救了她。黑人被送到了成人重新设置中心。故事以金发碧眼的女人成为三个拯救者的情妇圆满结束。他们合唱了一首合成四重奏，有最好的管弦乐队伴奏，还有芳香风琴的栀子花香。最后给了熊皮一个特写的镜头，中间穿插着高分贝的萨克斯音乐。一个立体的吻消失在黑暗中，最后那点儿酥麻快感在唇上颤动，像是飞蛾扑火后留下的微光，不停颤动，越来越弱，最后慢慢平静，归于静止。

　　但列宁娜心中的飞蛾并没有死去。甚至直到灯都亮起来，他们随着人流向电梯走去的时候，飞蛾的幽灵仍然在她唇上振翅，在她的皮肤上探索欲望和快感的痕迹。她的脸颊绯红，用力地搂住野蛮人的手臂，贴在自己的胸前，整个人变得瘫软。他垂眸看着她，脸色变得苍白，心痛而渴望着，又为自己的情欲感到羞愧。他配不上她，配不上……他们四目交对，她那会说话般的眼睛真像是珍宝一样！那是女王的气质。他匆忙将目光移开，抽出被俘虏的手臂。他吓坏了，害怕她不再是那个自己配不上的圣洁姑娘。

　　“我觉得你不该看这种东西，”他说，急于把过去和未来有可能毁掉列宁娜完美形象的原因转嫁到客观环境上去了。

　　“哪种东西，约翰？”

　　“类似这种可怕戏剧的东西。”

　　“可怕？”列宁娜非常吃惊。“我觉得很美好啊。”

　　“太低俗了，”他愤怒地说，“太下流了。”

　　她摇摇头。“我不明白你是什么意思。”他怎么这么奇怪？怎么会突然一反常态地破坏气氛？

　　在计程飞机里，他几乎没看她一眼。被从未说出口的承诺束缚着，遵从着那早已不起作用的法则，他扭过身体坐着，一声不吭。他的身体有时会激烈地抽动，就像绷得紧紧的琴弦被拨动一样。

　　计程飞机降落在列宁娜公寓的屋顶上。“终于到了”，她走出驾驶室时高兴地想。终于到了，即使他刚才那么奇怪。站在灯下，她拿出小镜子照了照。终于到了。她的鼻子有点儿泛油光。在他付计程费时，她抖了抖粉盒儿，在泛油光的地方补上粉。她想：“他简直太帅了，其实不用像贝尔纳那样腼腆的。要是换了别人，肯定早就上床了。好了，现在终于得手了。”镜中的自己露出了笑靥。

　　“晚安！”一个冰冷的声音从她身后传来。列宁娜转过身。约翰站在计程飞机的登机口处，直直地盯着她看；显然，从她开始补妆时，他就一直在看着等着。他在等什么？也许是在犹豫，试图下定决心，也许一直想，想——她猜不透他的心思。“晚安，列宁娜！”他重复道，想努力对她微笑，却只做出一个奇怪的表情。

　　“等等，约翰……我以为你……我的意思是，你难道不想……？”

　　他关上门，向前探身对司机说了什么，计程飞机飞向云端。

　　从窗户向下看，野蛮人能看见列宁娜扬起的脸，在灰蓝灯光的映射下显得苍白。她张嘴喊了些什么，她逐渐变小的身影急速离他而去；逐渐缩小的方形屋顶在黑暗中慢慢消散。

　　五分钟后，他回到自己的房间。从他藏东西的地方拿出被老鼠啃过的书，虔诚地翻阅着那脆弱褪色的书页。他在读《奥赛罗》，他记得奥赛罗是黑人，就像《直升机里的三星期》的男主角一样。

　　列宁娜擦干了眼泪，穿过屋顶走到电梯前。下到二十七楼之前，她拿出了唆麻药瓶。她觉得一克是不够的，一克唆麻并不足以治愈她的心痛。但是如果吃两克，可能明早就不能按时醒来。她做了折中的选择，向左手的掌心倒出了三粒半克的药片。

第21章 (1)


　　紧闭的门前，贝尔纳无奈地叫喊着，野蛮人不肯开门。

　　“所有人都在等你。”

　　“那就等着吧。”门后传来模糊低沉的回答。

　　“约翰，你很清楚，（要让高声嘶叫具有说服力是多么困难啊！）他们是特地来看你的。”

　　“你应该先问问我愿不愿意见他们。”

　　“你以前一直都见的。”

　　“正是如此，所以我现在不想见了。”

　　“就当是为了我！”贝尔纳近乎咆哮般劝说着，“让我高兴一下不好吗？”

　　“不好。”

　　“你说真的？”

　　“真的。”

　　“我可怎么办呐？”贝尔纳绝望地哀嚎起来。

　　“去死！”屋子里约翰被激怒了，大声吼道。

　　“但是坎特伯雷的社区首席歌唱家今晚会来。”贝尔纳都快哭出来了。

　　“哎呀塔克哇！”只有用祖尼语，野蛮人才能准确表达自己对社区首席歌唱家的感觉。“哈尼！”他想了一下又补充道，然后带着恶狠狠的嘲笑口气说：“松斯唉索切纳。”他向地上吐了一口痰，换作是波佩也会这样做。

　　最后，贝尔纳不得不绝望地回到他的屋里，向等得不耐烦的客人们交代：野蛮人今晚来不了。这个消息引起了众怒。男士们愤恨难平，觉得自己被骗了，以前竟然对这个卑微无用、声名狼藉、愤世嫉俗的家伙客客气气。社会地位越高的人，恨他就越深。

　　“竟然这样戏弄我！”首席歌唱家不停重复着，“戏弄我！”

　　女人们也满怀怒气，认为自己听信了假话——被那个瓶子里误加了酒精，只有伽玛减个头的小矮人骗了。太过分了！她们责骂着，声音越来越大。伊顿公学的女主任尤其不留情面。

　　只有列宁娜什么也没说。她脸色苍白，碧蓝的眼睛笼上了一层罕见的忧郁色彩，她坐在角落里，把自己孤立起来，因为没有人能了解她的情绪。她原本是带着一种急切的狂喜来参加这个聚会的。“再过几分钟”，她进屋时还在自言自语地说，“我就能看见他了，我要和他说话，要告诉他，”（因为她下定了决心才来的。）“我爱他，超过对其他所有人的爱。也许他会回答……”

　　他会怎么回答呢？她的脸涨得通红。

　　“那天晚上，看完感官剧之后，他怎么那么奇怪呢？太古怪了。但是我很肯定他很喜欢我，我很肯定……”

　　就在这时，贝尔纳宣布了野蛮人缺席的消息。

　　列宁娜突然体会到激情替代治疗中才会有的感觉，空虚得让人恐惧，担心得无法呼吸，晕眩反胃，心脏仿佛停止了跳动。

　　“也许他并不爱我，”她对自己说。这种可能性在她心里瞬间变成了不可撼动的事实：约翰没来，是因为不喜欢她，不喜欢她……

　　“太可耻了！”伊顿的女主任对火葬场兼磷回收站站长说，“一想到我曾经……”

　　“就是，”法妮·克朗说，“酒精的事肯定是真的。我朋友的朋友当年在胚胎室工作，她对我朋友说的，我朋友又告诉了我……”

　　“过分，真过分。”亨利·福斯特非常同情社区首席歌唱家。“你知道吗，我们前任主任曾经准备把他送去冰岛。”

　　每一个词都掷地有声。贝尔纳之前的自信如同膨胀的气球，现在千疮百孔，不成模样。他脸色苍白，忧心忡忡，焦虑不安地在客人间穿梭，语无伦次，结结巴巴地道歉，向他们保证下次野蛮人一定会来参加聚会，乞求他们坐下来尝尝胡萝卜三明治，维他命a馅饼，或是喝一杯香槟替代饮品。他们确实吃了，却完全无视他；一边喝东西，一边当着他的面指责，或是和别人一起对他指手画脚，就好像他是个透明人。

　　“现在，朋友们，”坎特伯雷首席歌唱家用弗德庆典领唱时那铜铃般优美洪亮的声音说，“我想我该告辞了！”他站起身，放下了杯子，掸掉他那紫色纤维胶马甲上的食品残渣，整理了一下衣服，向门口走去。

　　贝尔纳急忙跑去挽留他。

　　“首席歌唱家先生，您现在就要走吗？……时间还早呢。我恳请您能……”

　　是的，他没想到歌唱家先生会这么做。列宁娜曾偷偷告诉贝尔纳，如果给首席歌唱家发出邀请，他一定会接受的。“你知道吗，他非常亲切。”她曾向贝尔纳展示过在伦敦朗伯斯区度周末时，首席歌唱家送给她的t字形金拉链纪念品。贝尔纳还高兴地在每张邀请函上都写道：“坎特伯雷首席歌唱家将与野蛮人先生会面。”野蛮人什么时候不选，偏偏选在今天把自己锁在房间，还大喊“哈尼！”甚至“松斯唉索切纳！”（还好贝尔纳不懂祖尼语的意思）这个晚上，本应该是贝尔纳事业生涯最辉煌的时刻，现在却成了他最耻辱的时刻。

　　“我曾经希望……”他结结巴巴地重复着，看着歌唱家，眼睛里充满了乞求和惊慌。

　　“年轻人，”首席歌唱家庄重严厉地说，整个厅里顿时鸦雀无声，“我给你一个忠告。”他向贝尔纳晃动一根手指头，“趁着还没太迟，我给你个有用的忠告。”（他的声音变得格外阴沉。）“你要改邪归正啊，年轻人，改邪归正。”他在贝尔纳的头顶上画了个t字，转身离开了。“亲爱的列宁娜，”他变换了语气，“跟我走。”

　　列宁娜顺从地跟在他身后，没有笑，也没有兴高采烈（完全没有受宠若惊的神情）。其他的客人也都有秩序地、恭敬地跟着出去了。“砰”的一声，最后一个客人重重关上门，只留下贝尔纳一个人在那里。

　　他跌坐在椅子上，像一个泄了气的皮球，双手捂住脸开始哭泣。然而，过了几分钟，他想通了，吞下四片唆麻。

　　楼上的房间里，野蛮人在读《罗密欧与朱丽叶》。

　　列宁娜跟着首席歌唱家走出飞机，走上朗伯斯官邸的房顶。“年轻的朋友，快一点。我在说你呢，列宁娜。”首席歌唱家在电梯门口不耐烦地说。列宁娜停下来，看了会儿月亮，然后低下头，快步地穿过屋顶，到他身边。

　　穆斯塔法·孟德刚刚读完一份名为《生物学新理论》的文章。他坐了一会儿，皱眉沉思，然后提笔在标题页上写道：“作者采用数学方法诠释目标设置，非常新颖独特，但属于异端思想，对当前社会秩序不利，有潜在的危险性和颠覆性。不予发表。”他在最后四个字下划线强调。“严密监视该书作者，必要时把他打发到圣赫勒拿岛海洋生物站工作。”他签名的时候暗暗觉得可惜，因为这的确是一篇佳作。但是如果承认了目标设置方面的解释，后果将不堪设想。一不留神，这种思想就可能动摇高等种姓中立场不坚定的分子，让他们对幸福这至高的善失去信仰，转而相信真正的目标在当前社会之外，不再把维持安乐幸福当成人生目标，而是追求意识的深入和知识的拓展。这个追求本身并不赖，总统想，但在现有环境下必须斩草除根。他又拿起笔，在“不予发表”下边又划了一道线，比第一道更粗，颜色更深；然后叹了口气，“如果不用去考虑幸福，”他想，“那该有多好！”

　　约翰闭着眼睛，脸上焕发着神魂颠倒的神采，对着空房间柔声歌颂：

　　“啊！火炬远不及她的明亮；

　　她皎洁地悬挂在幕天的颊上，

　　像黑奴耳边璀璨的珠环；

　　她是天上明珠降落人间……”

　　金质的t字架在列宁娜的胸前格外闪耀。首席歌唱家抓住它，闹着玩似的晃了几下。长久的沉默后，列宁娜突然说：“我觉得我得吃点唆麻。”

　　此时的贝尔纳早已进入甜梦，在只属于他的天堂里微笑，微笑，微笑。但他床头上的电子钟的表针每隔三十秒钟都会向前跳一步，发出轻微的“滴答”声。滴答，滴答，滴答……天亮了，贝尔纳又回到了充满痛苦的时空。他情绪落到了冰点，搭乘计程飞机到条件设置中心上班。曾让他陶醉不已的成功像残留的酒精蒸发消逝，他又回到了卑微渺小的那个自己。如果说之前几周的他像飘飘然的气球，现在，他史无前例地感到身体像灌了铅一样沉重。

　　野蛮人出人意料地对泄了气的贝尔纳表现出同情。

　　“你现在更像在马尔佩斯时的样子，”贝尔纳诉说完他悲怆的遭遇后，野蛮人说，“还记得我们第一次的交谈么？在那所小房子外，你跟那时一模一样。”

　　“这是因为我又回到了不开心的生活。”

　　“换做是我，我宁愿不开心也不想通过弄虚作假来获得快乐。”

第22章 (2)


　　“可是我喜欢那样。”贝尔纳满腔苦楚。“都是你的错，不来参加我的聚会，让他们都背弃了我！”贝尔纳明知自己的话多么荒谬而不公正，他在心里承认（甚至差点说出口），野蛮人说得对，因为这么点小事就反目成仇的人没有被称为“朋友”的资格。尽管他明白并承认这一切，尽管约翰对他的支持和同情是他现在唯一的精神支柱，贝尔纳还是藏起心中真挚的感激，倔强地酝酿着怨恨，想要小小地报复一下野蛮人。毕竟，对首席歌唱家有再多不满，也没有任何发泄机会，又没办法报复装瓶主任和宿命设置助理主任。对贝尔纳来说，野蛮人比其他所有人更适合作报复对象，因为只有可能报复他。朋友的最主要的功能之一就是接受（以一种较温和的、象征性的形式）我们想施加却无法施加于敌人的惩罚。

　　另一个受害的朋友就是亥姆霍兹。遭遇挫败后，贝尔纳又想重新拉拢亥姆霍兹，然而，在他最光彩的时期，他一点也没想过维持这段友谊。亥姆霍兹接受了他，没有任何责备和挖苦，好像他早已经忘记了那次争吵。贝尔纳深受感动，同时又为亥姆霍兹的宽宏大量感到羞耻。他越是宽宏大量，贝尔纳就越觉得丢脸，因为这份宽容完全来源于亥姆霍兹的人格，而非唆麻的力量。接受他的不是唆麻假期中的亥姆霍兹，而是在生活中不计前嫌、胸襟开阔的亥姆霍兹。贝尔纳心怀感激（朋友的失而复得对他来说是极大的安慰），却也心怀怨恨（最好能报复一下他的过分宽容）。

　　在两人失和后第一次见面时，贝尔纳倾诉了他的悲惨遭遇，接受了安慰。直到几天后他才吃惊而羞愧地意识到，他并不是唯一深陷泥沼的人，亥姆霍兹也与领导起了冲突。

　　“事情起源于几首韵律诗，”亥姆霍兹解释道，“当时我正在给大三学生上高级情绪工程课。分十二讲，第七讲关于韵律诗，确切地说是韵律诗在道德宣传中的运用。我通常会在讲课时列举很多实际例子。于是，我给他们读了我自己写的韵律诗。这的确很疯狂，但是我实在心痒痒。”他笑起来，“我很好奇他们会有怎样的反应。另外，”他严肃地补充，“我想宣传一下自己的想法，想让他们也体会到我写诗时的感受。弗德在上！”他又笑了，“一下子就闹大了。校长威胁说要立即解雇我，所以我被盯上了。”

　　“你写了什么样的韵律诗？”贝尔纳问。

　　“主题是孤独。”

　　贝尔纳眉毛扬了起来。

　　“你想听，我可以给你背一遍。”亥姆霍兹开始背诵：

　　“昨夜召开委员会，

　　破鼓咚咚不停歇，

　　午夜迷城寂寞多，

　　长笛一奏魂魄飞。

　　朱唇闭，睡意浓，

　　机器停转静无声。

　　曾是杂乱喧闹地，

　　人群往来不肯休，

　　如今冷清多寂寥。

　　放声哭，低声泣，

　　却听故人诉衷肠，

　　不知其声似何人，

　　苏珊娜？艾瑞雅？

　　玉臂酥胸身边靠，

　　红唇翘臀惹人娇。

　　似梦似真不可辨，

　　懵懂不知在何方。

　　多愚蠢，真荒谬，

　　世上何存忘忧草！

　　助我度过凄冷夜，

　　鱼水之欢多无聊，

　　污秽空虚何时了？”

　　“哼，我就举了这个例子，他们就去校长那儿告状了。”

　　“这不奇怪，”贝尔纳说，“你的诗抨击了他们的睡眠教学。记住，他们为了反对孤独，已经发出过二十五万次警告。”

　　“我知道，但我想看看诗的效果如何。”

　　“喏，现在你看到了。”

　　亥姆霍兹只是笑，“我觉得，”他沉吟了一会儿说，“我终于有了写东西的灵感。仿佛身体里产生了一种力量供我使用，一种额外的潜在能量。我似乎会有什么新的际遇。”贝尔纳心想，尽管亥姆霍兹遇到了麻烦，他反倒挺开心的模样。

　　亥姆霍兹和野蛮人一见如故，惺惺相惜，这让贝尔纳疯狂地嫉妒起来。这两人即刻建立起来的友谊，比他和野蛮人共处几周的情谊还要深。看着他们交流，听着他们聊天，贝尔纳不时怨恨地想：如果没有介绍他们认识就好了。他为自己的嫉妒感到羞愧，交替着使用意志力和唆麻来控制情绪，但是徒劳无功；在唆麻假期的间隔中，总有难受的感觉侵袭而来。

　　第三次和野蛮人见面时，亥姆霍兹背诵了那段抒写孤独的韵律诗。

　　“你觉得怎么样？”背诵完后他问。

　　野蛮人摇摇头，回答说：“你听听这个。”打开放着被老鼠啃过的书的抽屉，翻开一本读道：

　　“让那歌喉最响亮的鸟雀，

　　飞上独立的凤树枝头，

　　宣布讣告，把哀乐奏响……”

　　亥姆霍兹越听越激动，从“凤树枝头”这句开始兴奋，听到“你这叫声刺耳的狂徒”时，他突然快活地微笑，又听见“任何专横跋扈的暴君”，热血直往上涌；但当他听到“死亡之音”时，他的脸色变得苍白，被一种前所未有的感情所感染，颤抖起来。野蛮人继续读：

　　“物性仿佛已失去规矩，

　　本身竟可以并非本身，

　　形体相合又各自有名，

　　既分为二又合二为一。

　　理智本身也无能为力，

　　分明看到合一的分离。”

　　“哦哈哈哈！”贝尔纳发出不悦的笑声，打断了朗诵。“这不就是一首赞美团结的颂歌嘛。”他这是在报复，因为两个朋友的亲密程度超过了跟他的友谊。

　　接下来的两三次见面中，他不断地重复着这样的报复伎俩。这是最简单有效的报复，因为看到水晶般剔透的诗歌受到这样的破坏和玷污，亥姆霍兹和野蛮人都非常痛苦。亥姆霍兹威胁他，如果他敢再这么捣乱，就将他赶到屋子外面去。然而，谁也没想到，接下来的一次打岔，最丢脸的一次，竟然是亥姆霍兹一手造成的。

　　当时野蛮人正带着强烈和颤抖的热情大声朗读《罗密欧与朱丽叶》（他一直都幻想自己是罗密欧，列宁娜是朱丽叶），亥姆霍兹带着困惑和兴趣欣赏情人们初次会面的场景。果然那一幕如诗的语言让他陶醉，但是表达出来的感情让他忍不住想笑。追求一个女孩需要那样的大费周章，实在是可笑。但是，从语言的细腻上来说，这段描写真是感情工程学中的杰作！“这位作家老先生，”他说，“能让我们最好的宣传专家甘拜下风。”野蛮人得意地笑了，又继续朗读。一切都很正常，直到第三幕最后一场，凯普莱特先生和太太威逼朱丽叶嫁给帕里斯伯爵时，朗诵这一幕期间亥姆霍兹一直在发出声响；当野蛮人模仿朱丽叶的语气，凄惨地大喊：

　　“天知道我心里是多么难过，

　　难道它竟会不给我一点慈悲吗？

　　啊，亲爱的妈妈！

　　请让婚礼延迟一个月，哪怕一个星期也行；

　　如果您不答应，

　　就把我的婚床放在提伯尔特长眠的幽暗坟茔里！”

　　听到朱丽叶的悲痛诉说，亥姆霍兹终于控制不住，狂笑起来。

　　妈妈和爸爸（真是荒唐下流的称呼）逼迫自己的女儿嫁给不喜欢的人！这女孩居然傻到不告诉他们自己心有所属（至少当时心是有所属的）！如此荒谬疯狂的场景实在滑稽。他之前还在竭力控制笑意；但听到那句“亲爱的妈妈”（再加上野蛮人那悲伤而颤抖的声调），又想到蒂伯尔特死后没有火葬，浪费了很多磷，他实在是压抑不住了。他不停笑，不停笑，笑到眼泪都掉下来，还是制止不住。野蛮人感到被侮辱，脸色变得惨白，从书中抬起头盯着他，笑声依旧。野蛮人愤慨地合上书站起来，像是把不慎丢到猪面前的珍珠捡起来，把书锁进了抽屉。

　　“不过，”亥姆霍兹终于喘上口气，能够道歉了。为了安抚野蛮人，他解释说：“我知道，戏剧需要这种滑稽疯狂的场景，营造冲突感，不这样写，就写不出好作品。那个老先生简直是渲染气氛的天才。他能描述出那么悲痛又癫狂的情节，让你难受，让你心烦，否则，你就体会不到那像x射线一样深邃尖锐的美好语言。可是，那些‘爸爸’‘妈妈’的称呼，”他摇了摇头，“实在让我严肃不起来。再说，谁会因为一个男孩儿得到或失去一个女孩儿而兴奋激动呢？”（野蛮人脸部肌肉在抽搐；但是亥姆霍兹一直望着天花板沉思，没有看见。）“没有谁会兴奋的。”他叹了口气得出结论，“我们需要更多疯狂和暴力场面。但是，什么样的场面？在哪里找？”他沉默了；然后摇头说，“我不知道，”最后又加上一句，“我不知道。”

第23章


　　胚胎室若隐若现的灯光下，亨利·福斯特的身影靠近过来。

　　“今晚想不想看场感官剧？”

　　列宁娜沉默地摇了摇头。

　　“和别人有约吗？”他对朋友中的花边新闻总是颇有兴趣。“是贝尼托么？”他问道。

　　她再次摇头。

　　亨利看到她紫色眼睛里的疲倦，皮肤上的斑点也隐藏不了脸色的苍白，暗红色的唇毫无笑意，流露着悲伤。“你不会是病了吧？”他有点儿担心地问，害怕她感染上尚未被消灭的传染病中的一种。

　　列宁娜还是摇头。

　　“不管怎样，你应该去看看医生，”亨利说，“一天一医生，疾病远离人。”他真诚的引用了睡眠学习的格言，然后拍了拍她的肩膀说，“你可能需要点代妊娠素，”他建议，“或者是一次超强度的激情替代治疗。你知道的，有时候，标准强度的治疗不够……”

　　“天呐，看在我主弗德的分上，”列宁娜终于张口说话了，“请闭嘴！”她转身去处理刚刚疏忽遗漏的胚胎。

　　去你的激情替代治疗！要不是现在痛苦地想哭，她一定会笑出声。难道她现在的情绪还不够强烈吗？她一边吸满注射器，一边深深地叹了口气。“约翰！”她喃喃地说，“约翰……”忽然，她喊了声，“天呐！”她糊涂了，“我给这个胚胎打过昏睡预防针了吗？没打过？”她完全忘记了。最后，她决定不要冒险重复注射，于是拿起了下一排的瓶子。

　　也许二十二年八个月零四天后，一个年轻有为的阿尔法减，可能是姆万扎的管理者，会死于嗜眠病——半个世纪来头一遭。列宁娜叹了口气，继续她的工作。

　　一个小时后，在更衣室，法妮提出了严重抗议，“让你自己变成这个样子，简直是荒谬，太荒谬了！”她重复着，“而且仅仅是因为一个男人，一个男人。”

　　“他是我唯一想要的男人。”

　　“世上有千千万万的男人。”

　　“他们都不是我想要的。”

　　“你不试试怎么知道？”

　　“我试过了。”

　　“试过几个？”法妮不屑地耸耸肩，“一个，两个？”

　　“几十个。但是，”她摇头，“没有一个合适，”她补充道。

　　“你得持之以恒，”法妮说教道。但是很明显她对自己开出的药方并不是很自信。“一分坚持，一分收获。”

　　“但是我总……”

　　“别再想他了。”

　　“我控制不住。”

　　“那就服用唆麻。”

　　“我吃过了。”

　　“那就再吃。”

　　“药效一消失，我就明白自己还是喜欢他，永远都会喜欢他。”

　　“如果是这样，”法妮果断地说，“你干脆霸王硬上弓，管他愿不愿意。”

　　“可你不知道他有多奇怪！”

　　“如果你下定决心，一切就都不是问题。”

　　“说起来容易。”

　　“别想那些有用没用的了，行动！”法妮用喇叭般洪亮的声音说；她以前准在弗德女青年协会给贝塔减青少年训过话。“没错，上，现在就上。”

　　“我害怕。”列宁娜说。

　　“那就先服半克唆麻壮壮胆。好了，我去洗澡啦。”法妮拖着浴巾走开了。

　　那个下午，野蛮人一直焦急地等着亥姆霍兹出现（他最终下定决心要和亥姆霍兹袒露他对列宁娜的感情，这个秘密，他实在藏不住了），门铃一响，他就跳起身去开门。

　　“我猜到是你了，亥姆霍兹。”他边开门边喊。

　　门口站着的却是列宁娜，她穿着绸缎海军衫，斜扣着一顶潇洒的小圆帽。

　　“天呐！”野蛮人好像遭受了当头一棒，惊呆了。

　　半克唆麻足以让列宁娜忘记害怕和尴尬。“你好，约翰！”她笑着说，从他身侧走进房间。他无意识地关上门跟在她身后。列宁娜坐了下来，长时间的沉默。

　　“看见我来，你好像一点儿都不高兴？”她终于开口。

　　“不高兴？”野蛮人带着责备的眼神看着列宁娜；突然间跪在她面前，握住她的手，恭敬的亲吻。“怎会不高兴？我多想你能明白我的心意。”他低语，勇敢地抬起眼睛看着她，“美丽的列宁娜，”他继续说下去，“我真的很仰慕你，你是世界上最值得珍惜的人。”列宁娜对他笑了笑，迷人而温柔。“你是如此的完美，”（她的嘴唇微张，慢慢向他靠近），“碧玉无暇，举世无双，”（嘴唇越来越近）“你是稀世珍宝。”（嘴唇近在咫尺）野蛮人突然站起身。“所以我才想，”他边说边把脸转开，“想要做些什么，向你证明，我配得上你。也许我永远没有足够的资格，但我想证明自己并非完全配不上你。我应该做点什么。”

　　“有什么必要……”列宁娜开口，却没有说完。声音中有一丝愤怒。当她慢慢靠近，想要亲吻他时，他却像个傻子一样突然站起来，让她扑了个空。即使那半克唆麻还在血液里生效，也免不了让她生气。

　　“在马尔佩斯，”野蛮人语无伦次地嘀咕，“得先送一张狮子皮，我是说，如果要娶哪个姑娘的话。或者送狼皮也行。”

　　“英格兰没有狮子！”列宁娜几乎要爆发了。

　　“即使这儿有，”野蛮人忽然带着鄙视和不满说，“人们肯定也是坐着直升机，用毒气之类的东西捕杀狮子。我不会这么做的，列宁娜。”他挺起胸膛，鼓起勇气看她，却看见列宁娜带着烦闷和不解盯着自己。他困惑了，“我会为你做任何事，”他越来越前言不搭后语，“只要是你想要的，我都会做。你知道，有些事的确不那么轻松，但是也可以做得很开心。我就是这么想的。我的意思是，如果你要我擦地板，我会很乐意。”

　　“我们这里有真空吸尘器啊，”列宁娜不解地说，“没必要擦地。”

　　“对，当然没必要。但是卑贱的工作有时也需要高贵的灵魂。我想要勇敢去经历，完成一些事。你能明白么？”

　　“可是，我们有真空吸尘器……”

　　“我想说的不是这个。”

　　“而且这些活是伊普西龙半傻子做的，”她继续说，“那么，老实说，你到底是为什么……”

　　“为什么？就是为了你啊。我想证明……”

　　“可是真空吸尘器和狮子能有什么关系？”

　　“证明我有多……”

　　“狮子和见到我很高兴又有什么关系？”她越来越恼怒。

　　“我有多爱你，列宁娜。”他近乎绝望地说出来。

　　内心惊喜的潮水仿佛推动血液往脸上涌，列宁娜脸涨得通红。“你是认真的吗，约翰？”

　　“原本我不打算说出来的，”野蛮人紧握着拳头，痛苦地喊出来。“想等到……列宁娜，你知道吗，在马尔佩斯，人们会结婚。”

　　“结什么？”刚刚消失的怒气，又出现在她声音里，他现在还胡扯什么啊？

　　“永远，他们会承诺永远生活在一起。”

　　“这个想法太可怕了！”列宁娜这回真的被吓到了。

　　“‘心灵的美丽比外表的美丽来得持久，因为心灵再生的速度远比血液衰老的速度要快得多。’”

　　“什么？”

　　“就像莎士比亚说的，‘但在一切神圣的仪式没有充分给你许可之前，你不能侵犯她处女的尊严……’”

　　“看在弗德的分上，约翰，别胡说了。你说的话，我一句也听不懂。开始是真空吸尘器；然后又是什么结，我快被你逼疯了。”她跳起来，抓住他的手腕，好像害怕他会突然跑开，也害怕他的心会飞走。“告诉我：你真的爱我吗，还是闹着玩儿的？”

　　沉默了一会儿，野蛮人轻柔地说：“我爱你，胜过爱这个世界上的一切。”

　　“那你为什么不早说？”她喊起来，那样的气恼，以至于她的长指甲陷进他手腕的皮肤里。“却一直在跟我说什么结、真空吸尘器、狮子什么的。你知不知道这几个星期我有多难过。”

　　她松开手，生气地把他的手腕甩开。

　　“要不是我如此爱你，”她说，“一定会对你发火。”

　　突然，她双臂环住他的脖子，软软的嘴唇贴上他的唇。那么柔软芳香，那么温暖酥麻，让他措手不及。他不可避免地想到了《直升机里的三星期》中那个拥抱。啊！啊！立体的金发女人，哦！哦！比现实还要真实的黑人。恐怖，恐怖，还是恐怖……他想要推开她，但是列宁娜抱得更紧了。

　　“为什么之前不告诉我？”她低语呢喃，挪开脸看着他，眼神中既有责备，也有爱怜。

　　“即使在最幽冥的暗室中，在最方便的场合（良心像雷鸣般富有诗意的呼喊），有伺隙而来的魔鬼的最强烈的煽惑，也不能使我的廉耻化为肉欲。不，绝不！”他断然地说。

　　“你这个笨蛋！”她说，“我如此渴求你，如果你也渴求我，还等什么……”

　　“但是，列宁娜……”他开始反对。她快速抽回手臂，走远了几步。他以为她明白了没有说出口的话。然而，当她解开白色的腰带，把它小心地搭在椅背上时，他怀疑自己想错了。

　　“列宁娜！”他焦虑地重复道。

　　她把手放在脖子前的拉链上，向下一拉；白色的海军衫落到地上。怀疑的迷雾凝结成过于坚实的事实。“列宁娜，你要干什么？”

　　“嘶拉，嘶拉！”她无声地回答了他，慢慢地褪下她的喇叭裤。她的拉链内衣是像贝壳般的灰粉色。社区首席歌唱家送给她的金t字架在她的胸前晃动。

　　“那对透过窗棂映射到男人眼里的雪白乳峰……”雷鸣般的诗歌，魔力般的语言，让她看起来更加危险妖娆。柔软，柔软的乳峰，如此打动人心！它们钻破了理智，刺穿了决心。“血液中的火焰一燃烧起来，最坚强的誓言也形同草秆。节制一些吧，否则……”

　　“嘶拉！”两个圆圆的、闪耀粉红光彩的乳房像分成两半的苹果，一下子暴露出来。两只胳膊一晃，右脚一抬，左脚一抬，拉链内衣也被褪到了地上，好像失去生命一样泄了气。

　　她仍然穿着鞋袜，头上的小圆帽调皮地倾斜。她走向他，“亲爱的，亲爱的！你要是早点儿说出来就好了！”她伸出双手。

　　可是野蛮人没有伸出双手，同样回以“亲爱的”，他害怕地退却了，向她做出驱赶的手势，好像面前站的是猛兽一样。连退四步，他已经背靠墙壁。

　　“甜心！”列宁娜呼唤着，把手搭在了他的肩上，紧紧地靠向他。“搂着我！”她命令道，“抱着我直到我心醉，亲爱的。”她的命令也充满了诗意，她知道有些歌词像咒语，像鼓点。“亲吻我！”她闭上了眼睛，她把声音放低变成喃喃低语，“亲吻我直到我情迷。抱着我，亲爱的，温柔地……”

　　野蛮人抓住她的手腕，从自己肩膀上掰开，粗鲁地把她推到几尺之外。

　　“好疼！你怎么……天呐！”她突然间不敢出声，恐惧让她忘记了疼痛。她看到了他的脸，不，那不是他的脸，是一张残忍的陌生人的脸，苍白、扭曲、发狂般的抽搐，带着莫名的暴怒。她被吓得目瞪口呆，小声地问，“约翰，你怎么了？”他没有回答，只是用癫狂的眼神死死盯着她，握着她手腕的手不停地颤抖。他强烈而不规则地喘着粗气。她突然听到他咬牙的声音，害怕得快要晕倒过去。“怎么回事？”她近乎尖叫着说。

　　他仿佛被她的尖叫唤醒了，抓着她的肩膀前后晃动。“荡妇！”他大喊着，“你个厚颜无耻的妓女！”

　　“不要，啊！不要！”她的抗议声因为身体的晃动而奇怪地颤抖。

　　“婊子！”

　　“求求你放开我。”

　　“该下地狱的婊子！”

　　“一，一克唆，唆麻，好过烦恼……”她断断续续地说出格言。

　　野蛮人猛地将她推开，她踉踉跄跄地跌倒在地。“滚！”他气势汹汹地俯视她，“再也别出现在我视野里，否则我会杀了你。”他拳头握得咯吱作响。

　　列宁娜抬起手挡住脸。“求你别这样，约翰……”

　　“快滚！”

　　列宁娜战战兢兢地看着他每一个举动，一只胳膊仍然护着额头，慌慌张张地爬起来，然后飞奔向浴室。

　　他一个巴掌挥过去，把她向前推了好几步，像是射出膛的子弹。

　　“哇啊！”列宁娜踉跄地往前一蹿。

　　她安全冲进浴室，反锁上门后，才开始慢慢查看身上的伤。她背对着镜子扭头看，望见左肩上五个红手指印，在雪白肌肤的映衬下尤为明显。她小心翼翼地揉了揉伤处。

　　浴室外，野蛮人在房间中来回走动，踏着像咒语、像鼓点的节奏。“鹪鹩都在干那把戏，金苍蝇也当着我的面公然交合。”他的耳朵里回荡着这样的声音。“其实她自己干起那回事来，比艾鼬和骚马还要浪得多。她们上半身虽然是女人，下半身却是淫荡的妖怪；腰带以上虽属于天神，腰带以下全属于魔鬼。那儿是地狱，那儿是黑暗，那儿是火坑，吐着熊熊的烈焰，发出熏人的恶臭，把一切烧成了灰。呸，呸，呸，痛苦啊痛苦！亲爱的药师，给我称一两麝香，让我净化一下我的想象。”

　　“约翰！”浴室里传来哀求声。“约翰！”

　　“你这野草闲花啊！你的颜色是这样娇美，你的香气是这样芬芳，人家看见你嗅到你就会心疼。这一本美丽的书册，是要让人家写上‘娼妓’两个字的吗？天神见了它要掩鼻而过……”

　　但是她的芬芳仍然包围着他，他白色的夹克上沾上了粉，那是她之前拍在天鹅绒般滑腻皮肤上的香粉。“不要脸的淫妇，不要脸的淫妇，不要脸的淫妇！”那无情的节奏兀自重复着，“不要脸的……”

　　“约翰，可以让我穿上衣服吗？”

　　他捡起喇叭裤，衬衫和拉链内衣。

　　“开门！”他踢着门命令道。

　　“不要，我不开。”声音里满是恐惧和反抗。

　　“那我怎么给你衣服？”

　　“从门上的通风口递进来。”

　　他照做了，又焦躁地在房里来回踱步。“不要脸的淫妇，不要脸的淫妇。那个屁股肥胖，手指粗得像马铃薯般的荒淫的魔鬼……”

　　“约翰。”

　　他不想应声。“屁股肥胖，手指粗得像马铃薯般。”

　　“约翰。”

　　“干吗？”他粗暴地问。

　　“能不能请你把马尔萨斯腰带递给我。”

　　列宁娜坐着，听着外面房间的脚步声，猜想着野蛮人要这样来来回回走多久；是不是得等到野蛮人离开，她才能脱身；或者给他一些时间，让他消消气，冷静一下，然后再打开浴室门，飞快地冲出去？会不会太危险？

　　她被自己杂乱的猜测弄得心神不定，直到外屋里响起电话铃，踱步的鼓点戛然而止。她听见野蛮人接电话。

　　“你好。”

　　……

　　“我就是。”

　　……

　　“我就是，我不能冒充我自己。”

　　……

　　“是的，你听不懂我的话吗？我就是野蛮人。”

　　……

　　“什么？谁病了？我当然想知道。”

　　……

　　“病得厉害吗？她很不舒服？我马上就去……”

　　……

　　“不在她房间了？她被送到哪儿去了？”

　　……

　　“天啊！请告诉我地址。”

　　……

　　“公园街三号是吗？三号？谢谢。”

　　列宁娜听到挂电话的声音，然后是匆匆离去的脚步和“砰”的关门声。随后一片寂静。他真的走了么？

　　她小心谨慎地把门拉开一条缝，窥探了半天，惊喜地发现没有人。她又把门开大了一些，把头探出去，最后蹑手蹑脚地走出来。她的心怦怦直跳，站了好一会，仔细地听了又听，然后突然向门口狂奔，开门，快速溜出去，关上门，撒腿就跑。直到冲进电梯，开始下降时，她才松了口气。

第24章


　　公园街垂危病人医院是一座六十四层的塔楼，外墙上都镶着报春花色的瓷砖。野蛮人刚一踏出计程飞机，就看到一架色彩鲜艳的空中灵车轰鸣着从屋顶起飞，穿过公园，向西边的泥沼火葬场飞去。在电梯门口，门房回答了他的提问。他坐电梯上到17层，来到81号病房（门房告诉他那是急性衰老病房）。

　　那是一间很大的病房，墙壁上刷着黄色涂漆，阳光照进来，显得很明亮。病房里共有20张床，都住满了人。琳达躺在那里，奄奄一息——和其他病人一起，享受着现代化设备。空气中永远流淌着合成的优美旋律，每张床的床尾处都有一台电视机，朝向垂危的病人，从早开到晚，像是一直开着的水龙头。每隔十五分钟，屋子里就会自动变换一种香味。“我们做了很多努力，”接待野蛮人的护士解释着，“试图营造一种舒适怡人的气氛，介于顶级酒店和感官剧院两种氛围之间，你明白我的意思吧。”

　　“她在哪儿？”野蛮人问，完全不搭理护士善意的解释。

　　护士很不高兴地说，“你很赶时间么？”

　　“还有希望么？”他问。

　　“你的意思是，救活她的命？”他点点头。“不，当然没希望了。送到这儿来的人都没有希……”或许是被他惨白的脸上那种痛苦的表情吓到了，她突然住了嘴。“怎么了，有什么大不了的？”她问。像野蛮人这样的探病者显然让她很不适应。（不管怎么说，这儿的探病者一向就不多：凭什么探病者会多呢？）“你是不是哪里不舒服？”

　　他摇了摇头。“她是我的母亲。”他的声音小得快听不到。

　　护士用一种受惊、恐慌的目光看了他一眼，然后很快移开视线，她的脸从太阳穴红到了脖子根。

　　“带我去看她。”野蛮人竭力保持平稳的语气。

　　护士红着脸把他带到病房。当他们走进病房时，病人们转过脸看他们，面孔看起来丰润年轻（急性衰老的病症非常快，心脏和大脑迅速老化，面孔还来不及衰老）。他们用空洞茫然的眼神追随着探病者的身影，就像回到了婴儿初生时的状态。野蛮人感到不寒而栗。

　　琳达躺在最顶头的那张床上。她坐靠在枕头上，正在看南美洲黎曼球场的网球锦标赛半决赛，电视无声地放映，画面被缩小了。在那发光的方形屏幕上，运动员们无声地跑动着，像鱼缸里的鱼一样——在另一个世界激情而无声地活动着。

　　琳达继续看着电视，带有迷糊而痴傻的微笑。她那张苍白臃肿的脸上，流露出傻子一样的欢愉。她时不时合上眼睛，好像是在打盹儿，然后微微一惊，又醒过来，看着“鱼缸”里那些滑稽可笑的网球运动员，听着超高音歌唱家伍利策瑞安娜的《抱着我直到我心醉，亲爱的》，闻着她头上的气窗吹进来的马鞭草的香吻。她醒了过来，或者说，她又来到了现实的梦中：血液中的唆麻让电视、歌声和香氛变得更为美妙，构成了完美的梦境。她带着婴儿式的满足，再次露出残败而褪色的微笑。

　　“好了，我得走了。”护士说，“一大帮孩子要过来了，再说，还要看紧三号床。”她指着另一边的病床说，“那人随时都可能死掉。那么，你请便。”护士匆匆离开了。

　　野蛮人在床边坐下来。

　　“琳达！”他抓着她的手，低声呼唤。

　　听见有人喊她的名字，琳达转回头。那双无神的眼睛，在看到他后突然亮了起来。她紧紧地握着他的手，笑了，嘴唇动了动，突然，脑袋向前一倾，她又睡着了。他坐在那儿看着她——抚摸着她那疲惫的身体，试图找回曾经在马尔佩斯时留在他记忆中的那张年轻明亮的脸。他找到了，闭上眼睛，他回忆着她的声音，她的一举一动，他们一起度过的每时每刻。“草色链球菌马儿，带我去班伯里t区……”她的歌声是多么动听！儿时的歌谣是多么的迷人和神秘，像是有魔力一样。

　　“a，b，c呀，维他命d：

　　肝脏里的脂肪，海洋中的鲟鱼。”

　　回忆起那些童谣和琳达的歌声，他热泪盈眶。他又想起阅读课：娃娃在瓶子里，猫咪在垫子上，还有《胚胎室贝塔工人初级操作指南》。他们在火堆边一坐就是一个晚上，夏天在小屋的房顶上，她给他讲述保留地之外的那个最美最美的地方——一个充满善良和美丽的天堂。虽然接触到这个现实的伦敦和那些现实的文明人，他对那个天堂依然保持着完整而纯洁的回忆。

　　突如其来的尖叫声让他睁开了眼睛，他胡乱地擦干眼泪，环顾四周。一群八岁的多生子男孩儿鱼贯而入，像是延绵不绝的小溪。一个跟着一个，一个接着一个，他们的到来就像是噩梦。他们的脸，一样的脸——那么多人却只有一张面孔，长得像哈巴狗一样，大鼻孔，无神的大眼睛。他们的制服都是卡其色的。他们进来的时候，都张着嘴高声地喋喋不休。一瞬间，病房像是爬满了蛆虫。他们穿梭在病床间的空隙处挤来挤去，有的爬上病床，有的在床下穿行，有的挤到电视机前张望，有的对病人们做鬼脸。

　　琳达的样子让他们吃惊，更让他们害怕。一群人挤在她的床尾，像是突然看到了不明的怪物一样带着恐惧和愚蠢的好奇盯着她。

　　“哇，快看，快看！”他们压低的声音中夹杂着惊慌，“她怎么这副样子？为什么这么肥？”

　　他们从没有见过这样一张脸，既不年轻，皮肤也不紧绷，身材胖得走样，还驼背。医院里六十多岁的垂死老人都有着小女孩儿般的容貌，四十四岁的琳达却与其他人形成鲜明对比，像个身躯松弛扭曲的老怪物。

　　“她太可怕了！”一些孩子窃窃私语着，“看她的牙齿！”

　　突然，一个哈巴狗脸的多生子从床底下钻出来，跳到约翰的椅子和墙壁中间，盯着琳达熟睡的脸颊。

　　“我说……”他刚张开嘴说话，还没说完就变成了尖叫。野蛮人抓着他的领子，把他从椅子边拎了起来，结结实实地给了他一个耳光，打得他嚎叫着跑掉了。

　　听到嚎叫声的护士长急忙赶了过来。

　　“你对他做了什么？”她凶狠地追问道，“我不准你打孩子！”

　　“那好，你让他们离这病床远点儿。”野蛮人的声音愤怒得有些颤抖。“这些乳臭未干的脏孩子到这里来干吗？不成体统！”

　　“不成体统？你这是什么意思？他们正在接受死亡条件设置啊。我告诉你，”她粗暴地警告他，“如果再让我发现你干扰死亡设置，我就叫门房把你扔出去。”

　　野蛮人站起身向她靠近，他咄咄逼人的行动和表情让护士长害怕地往后退。他竭尽全力控制住自己，没有说话，转身又回到床边坐了下来。

　　护士长松了口气，用刺耳的声音不太有把握地维护尊严：“我警告过你了，”护士长说，“我可警告过你了，”护士长又说，“你记住。”她最后还是把那些好奇心旺盛的多生子们带走了，让他们去玩“找拉链”。她的同事正在病房的另一边组织游戏。

　　“去喝你的咖啡饮料吧，亲爱的。”她对另外一个护士说。成功维护权威的快慰让她恢复了自信和好心情。“好了，孩子们！”她呼唤道。

　　琳达不安地动起来，睁着眼睛朦胧地看了一会儿周围，又一次昏睡过去。野蛮人坐在她身边，努力捕捉回几分钟前的心境。“a，b，c呀，维他命d。”他重复着，好像这是魔咒，会让逝去的往昔起死回生一样。可惜咒语并未奏效，美好的记忆并没有回来，那些关于嫉妒、丑陋和痛苦的记忆像梦魇般复活了。肩膀被砍伤、滴着血的波佩；睡相丑陋的琳达；床边打翻的龙舌兰酒瓶上嗡嗡乱飞的苍蝇；琳达走过时，给她起难听外号的顽童……啊，不，不！他闭上了眼睛，使劲地摇着头，竭力拒绝这些回忆。“a，b，c呀，维他命d……”他试着回忆小时候，坐在琳达的膝盖上，她抱着他，一遍又一遍地唱着，轻轻地摇着他，摇着他，哄他睡着。“a，b，c呀，维他命d，维他命d，维他命d……”

　　伍利策瑞安娜的超级高音逐渐上升到如泣如诉的高度，香味循环系统中的马鞭草的香气突然变成浓郁的广藿香。琳达动了动，醒了过来，莫名其妙地盯着半决赛的画面看了几秒钟，然后抬起脸来，闻了闻刚刚变换了香味的空气，突然笑了——带着孩子般的得意。

　　“波佩！”她呢喃着，闭上了眼睛。“啊，我真喜欢这样，真喜欢……”她叹了口气，又倒进枕头里。

　　“琳达！”野蛮人哀求地说，“你还认识我吗？”他已经尽了最大的努力，她为什么总是忘不了他？他紧握着她那双无力的手，甚至有些过于用力，好像希望通过这种方式强迫她从猥亵的春梦中醒来，让她摆脱这种低俗、可耻的记忆。回到现在，回到现实中来，回到这个可怕的现在，这个糟糕的现实中来——但这现实又是伟大的，是有意义的，是极其重要而且恰如其分的，因为那种即将到来的死亡，会让人们畏惧。“你不认识我了吗，琳达？”

　　他隐约感觉到了她的手无力地攥了一下，作为回答。他的眼睛湿润了，弯下腰吻了吻她。

　　她的嘴唇动了动，“波佩！”她又喃喃低语。约翰感觉好像是被人泼了一脸粪便。

　　他怒火中烧。第二次的受挫让他的悲伤有了另一种发泄的渠道，变成了极度痛苦的愤怒。

　　“可是我是约翰啊！”他大声叫喊。“我是约翰！”他因为痛苦，愤怒地抓住她的肩膀摇晃起来。

　　琳达突然睁开了眼睛，她看到了他，认出了他，“约翰！”但是又把那张现实中的脸和那双真实有力的手带回了想象中的世界——把他放在广藿香和高音伍利策之间，放在变形的回忆和离奇的梦之中。她知道那是约翰，是她的儿子，但是却把他幻想为闯入马尔佩斯天堂的入侵者，那儿是她和波佩一起度唆麻假期的地方。约翰很愤怒，因为她爱波佩；他不断地摇晃她，因为波佩在她的床上——好像她哪里做错了一样，好像其他文明人都不会这么做似的。“每个人都属于彼此……”她的声音突然变得毫无生气，她呼吸困难地张着嘴，却没有一点儿声音。她张着嘴，绝望地想多吸入一点空气，却好像忘记了怎样呼吸。她想叫喊，却怎么都发不出声；只有从那圆睁着、充满恐惧的眼睛中，才能看出她巨大的痛苦。她的手放在脖子上，然后抓着空气——抓着她再也不能吸入的空气，抓着渐渐离她远去的空气。

　　野蛮人站起来，向她弯下腰。“你说什么，琳达？你说什么？”他哀求着，求她让他放心。

　　她看着他，眼神中流露着不可言说的恐惧，在他看来，那是一种责备。

　　她试图自己从床上坐起来，但最终还是跌回到枕头上。她的脸恐怖地扭曲着，嘴唇也变得乌青。

　　野蛮人转身向病房外跑。

　　“来人！快来人！”他大喊着，“快！”

　　护士长站在玩游戏的多生子们围成的圈里，转过头。她起初一惊，随即就变得正气凛然。“别喊了！为这些孩子想想。”她皱着眉说，“你可能会破坏他们的条件设置，你到底在干吗？”他已经钻进了圆圈中。“啊，小心点！”一个孩子喊着。

　　“快，快去！”他拉着她的衣服袖子，拖着她快步前进，“快！出事了！我害死了她。”

　　他们回到病房时，琳达已经死了。

　　野蛮人像冻结般沉默地站在那儿，然后跪在床边，双手捂面，无法抑制地啜泣起来。

　　护士犹豫不决地站在旁边，看着跪在床前的人（多么可耻的场景），又看了看孩子们（他们真可怜）。多生子们已经停止了“找拉链”，从病房的另一头向这边望过来，瞪着大眼睛，看着20号病床边这场丑恶的表演。她应该和他说句话吗？让他停止这种有伤风化的举动？告诉他现在在哪儿，提醒他这么做会对这些无辜的孩子造成多么致命的伤害，用这种恶心的声音来破坏有利身心的死亡条件设置——就好像死亡有多可怕一样，就好像死亡有多严重一样！这可能会使孩子们产生毁灭性的想法，可能会扰乱他们，让他们做出与社会伦理背道而驰的行为。

　　护士长走上前，拍拍他的肩膀说：“你不能老实点儿吗？”她恼怒地低声劝诫。然而，她环顾四周，看到六七个孩子已经起身向病房这边走过来了。圆圈马上要散了。马上就……不行，这太危险了。如果这次的条件设置失败了，那么这群孩子的条件设置会被推迟六七个月。她赶紧回到受到威胁的孩子们身边。

　　“现在，谁想吃一块巧克力蛋糕？”她用活泼的语气大声地问。

　　“我！”整个波卡组的孩子们异口同声地叫起来，20号病床被忘光了。

　　“哦，上帝，上帝，上帝啊！”野蛮人不断地自言自语，在悲伤与懊悔夹杂的混乱中，唯一清楚的词汇就是上帝。“上帝啊！”他低声呼唤，“上帝……”

　　“他到底在说什么啊？”一个声音问道，那声音很近，很清晰，从高音伍利策婉转的歌声中穿透出来。

　　野蛮人猛然地转过身，松开捂着脸的双手，往四周看了看。五个穿着卡其色制服的多生子站成一排，像哈巴狗似的盯着他，每个人手里都拿着半块点心。他们相同的面容上，沾满不同形状的融化了的巧克力。

　　他们和约翰一对上视线，就不约而同地笑起来，其中一个还用长条状的蛋糕指着琳达。

　　“她死了么？”他问。

　　野蛮人默默地瞪了他们一会儿，然后，又默默地站起来，默默地向门口走。

　　“她死了么？”那个好奇的多生子跟在他身后，又问。野蛮人低头看着他，默默地把他推开。那孩子摔倒在地上，立刻大哭起来。野蛮人头也不回地走掉了。

第25章


　　公园街垂危病人医院一共有一百六十二个卑贱的下等工人，分成两个波卡小组，其中一组是八十四个红发多生女，另一组是七十八个暗色皮肤的长脸多生男。一般情况下，他们六点下班，两个小组在医院前厅集合，在会计助理那里领取定量的唆麻。

　　从电梯出来后，野蛮人的思想被死亡、悲痛、懊悔充斥着。他就像机器人一样，意识不到自己在做什么，径直往人群中间挤。

　　“你挤什么挤？你以为自己在哪儿？”

　　混杂的人群中传出两个声音，一高一低，一个支支吾吾，一个咆哮不停，像是在一大排镜子前不停地重复。两类脸恶狠狠地朝向他：一类长着雀斑，没有毛，如同被橘黄色的光环包围的月亮；一类脸瘦长，尖嘴，蓄着两天没有刮的胡茬。两个声音和撞在他肋骨上的手肘唤回了他的意识。他立刻回到了现实，环顾他的周围，带着一种恐惧和厌恶的情绪，明白了眼前的景况。日夜复发的狂乱病和蚁群般无法辨别的相同面孔，如噩梦般永无止境。多生子，多生子……他们像蛆虫一样穿梭在琳达死亡的迷雾里。现在，蛆虫又出现在他面前，只是大了好多倍，长成了人。他用迷惑恐惧的眼神盯着那些卡其色的怪物。他站在他们面前，足足高出一头。“那儿有多么美妙的生灵啊！”那歌声不无嘲讽：“人类多么善良！啊！美妙的新世界……”

　　“发唆麻了，”一个声音高喊着：“都排好队，快一点。”

　　门开了，桌子和椅子已经挪到了走廊里。说话的是一个年轻的阿尔法，他搬着一个黑铁钱箱进来了。多生子满怀期待，发出满意的呢喃。他们一心关注着桌上的黑铁钱箱，早已将野蛮人抛掷脑外。马上就要开箱了！箱盖被揭开。

　　“哇哈！”一百六十二个人异口同声地欢呼，仿佛在看烟花表演。

　　年轻人掏出一把小药盒，专横地说，“现在往前走，一个一个来，不准拥挤。”

　　多生子没有拥挤，一个个地往前走。先是两个男人，然后一个女人，接着一个男人，三个女人，如此轮流……

　　野蛮人看着这一切，“啊！美妙的新世界。啊！美妙的新世界！”在他心里，歌声似乎变了调。在他如此痛苦和懊悔的时刻，每个歌词都尖酸地嘲讽着他。它们像恶魔一样狂笑，用令人作呕的、丑陋的噩梦嘲弄他。突然，这歌声变成豪迈的号角，召唤他战斗。“啊！美妙的新世界！”米兰达宣扬着美好生活的可能性：让噩梦变成美好事物的可能性。“啊！美妙的新世界！”这是一种挑战，一种命令。

　　“喂，那边不要挤！”会计助理狂怒地叫嚷着。他“砰”地关上了钱箱，“你们要是不遵守秩序，我就不发了。”

　　德尔塔们小声咕哝了几句，相互推搡了几下，停了下来。威胁生效了。还有什么比扣发唆麻更加可怕呢？

　　“这下好多了。”年轻人说着，打开了他的钱箱。

　　琳达沦落成一个奴隶，现已命丧黄泉。其他人应该获得自由，世界应该变得美好。这是一种补偿，一种责任。突然，像是出现了一道光芒，让野蛮人明白了自己应该做什么。就像是一道百叶窗打开了，窗帘拉了起来。

　　“下一个，”会计助理说。

　　另一个女卡其上前。

　　“停！”野蛮人大叫着，“停！”

　　德尔塔们惊愕地看着他向桌边挤去。

　　“弗德啊！”会计助理屏住呼吸，“是野蛮人！”他不禁心生恐惧。

　　“我恳求你，”野蛮人诚挚地说，“让我借一下你们的耳朵。”他从没有在公共场合讲过话，现在发现表达自己想说的话太难了。“不要碰那些东西，那是毒品，是毒品啊。”

　　“我说，野蛮人先生，”会计助理试图用微笑平息事端，“你不介意让我先……

　　“那是侵蚀灵魂和肉体的毒药！”

　　“也许吧。但是让我先发完了好不好？你是个明事理的好先生。”他拍打着野蛮人的肩膀，就像充满温柔地抚摸一只凶猛的动物，“就让我先……”

　　“绝对不行！”野蛮人大叫着。

　　“老兄，听我说……”

　　“把那些可怕的毒品全部扔掉。”

　　“全部扔掉”几个字刺穿了德尔塔们朦胧的意识，人群中传出了愤怒的呢喃。

　　“我是来带给你们自由的。”野蛮人转身面向多生子们，“我是来……”

　　会计助理没有继续听下去，他偷偷溜出门厅，在电话簿上查询一个号码。

　　“没在他自己的房间。”贝尔纳总结道，“没在我的房间，没在你的房间，没在爱美神馆，也没在大学中心。他会去哪儿呢？”

　　亥姆霍兹耸了耸肩。他们下班后以为野蛮人在平常见面的某个地点等他们，却半天不见踪影，真让人恼火。本打算乘亥姆霍兹的四架直升飞机到比亚利茨去的，如果野蛮人还不出现，晚餐怕是赶不上了。

　　“再等五分钟吧。”亥姆霍兹说，“如果他还不出现，我们就……”

　　电话铃声打断了他。他接起电话说：“你好，请讲。”他听了一会，咒骂道：“弗德在上！我马上过去。”

　　“出什么事了？”贝尔纳问。

　　“那家伙在公园街医院。”亥姆霍兹说，“野蛮人就在那，好像要疯了。情况很紧急。你和我一起去吗？”

　　两人匆匆坐上电梯。

　　“你们喜欢做奴隶吗？”当他们走进医院时，野蛮人正发表着演说，他的脸涨得通红，眼睛里充满了热情和义愤。“还是你们喜欢做婴儿？哇哇哭、还吐奶的婴儿。”他补充道。他想要拯救的人们是那么愚昧，让他不禁恼怒而说出侮辱性的话。那些话语撞在愚昧的厚壳上被反弹回来。他们面无表情地盯着他，眼神里流露出阴沉的迟钝和怨恨。“还在吐奶的婴儿！”他理直气壮地大喊。现在，伤心、怨恨、同情和责任都被置之脑后。那些禽兽不如的怪物激起了他的憎恨，这浓烈的感情驾驭了他。“难道你们不想成为人，获得自由吗？难道你们连什么是人类，什么是自由都不明白？”愤怒使他滔滔不绝，话语迸溅而出。“难道你们不明白？”他不断发问，却没有得到答案，“好吧。”他的声调变得冷酷，“让我来教你们。你们想也好，不想也好，我都会给你们自由。”他推开一扇朝向医院庭院的窗户，把装唆麻的小药盒一把一把扔出去。

　　一时间，卡其色怪物们呆若木鸡。面对这种渎圣的行为，他们只感到惊愕和恐惧。

　　“他疯了。”贝尔纳睁圆了眼睛小声说着，“他会被杀的，他会……”突然，怪物们发出一声叫喊，人群气势汹汹地向野蛮人涌去。“弗德保佑！”贝尔纳惊恐地转移目光，不敢看下去。

　　“弗德保佑自救之人。”亥姆霍兹·沃森笑了，笑声掺杂着癫狂与喜悦。他推开人群，走上前去。

　　野蛮人大喊着“自由，自由”，一只手继续往窗外扔唆麻，另一只手击打着袭击者们千篇一律的脸。“自由！”突然，亥姆霍兹站在了他的身边。“亥姆霍兹，好兄弟。”他也挥起了拳头。“终于做人了！”亥姆霍兹边说边也往窗外扔毒品。“对，做人了，做人了！”毒品全部被扔掉了，他抓起钱箱，向他们展示空空如也的黑色内胆，“你们自由了！”

　　德尔塔们暴怒着咆哮。

　　站在战争边缘的贝尔纳迟疑不决，“他们完了！”他嗟叹着，突然有一股冲动，想上前帮助他们；但转念一想又心生顾虑。他为帮不上忙感到羞愧，正想上前，又忍不住退缩了。他为自己的犹豫感到羞耻，苦恼地站在那里。如果他不去帮忙，朋友们可能会被杀，如果他去帮忙，可能连自己的命都搭进去。正在这时，谢天谢弗德！一群警察冲了过来，戴着凸起的护目镜和猪鼻子形状的防毒面具。

　　贝尔纳一路短跑迎接他们，他挥着胳膊，心想至少自己还能做点什么。他一遍遍大喊：“救命，救命！”声音一次比一次大，仿佛试图说服自己确实帮上了忙。“救命！救命！”

　　警察把他推开，继续执行任务。三个警察肩上扛着喷雾剂，往空气中不停地喷射唆麻浓烟；两个警察在手提合成箱前忙碌着；还有四个警察冲进人群，用装满强麻醉剂的喷枪攻击打得不可开交的人们。

　　“快点，快点！”贝尔纳大叫着。“再不快点，他们会被杀死的。他们会……哎呀！”一个警察对他的喋喋不休很恼火，就给了他一麻醉枪。他立刻觉得晕头转向，站都站不稳，好像没有了骨头和肌肉似的，变成了两根冰棍，最后连冰棍也不是了，化成了水。他摇晃了一两秒钟就摔倒了，绵绵地瘫在地上。

　　忽然，合成音乐箱里传出了一个声音，充满理智与善意。合成录音带正在播放二号（中等强度）反暴乱演说，这声音仿佛发自一个不存在的心灵深处。“我的朋友们，亲爱的朋友们！”这个声音如此哀伤，温柔中蕴含责备。即使那些戴着防毒面具的警察们也瞬间泪眼朦胧，“你们这是在干什么？为什么大家不能幸福快乐地待在一起？幸福快乐！”那个声音重复着，“和平相处，和平相处。”声音颤抖着，变成轻柔细语，再慢慢消失。“我希望你们都能幸福。”声音又出现了，带着一种真挚的渴望。“我希望你们都能快乐，请你们快乐……”

　　两分钟后，演说和唆麻雾气起作用了。德尔塔们含着眼泪互相亲吻拥抱着，六七个多生子们彼此理解地抱成一团。亥姆霍兹和野蛮人也差点哭了出来。有人从会计室里拿出一个新的药盒箱，匆忙开始新一轮分发。随着男中音告别辞的结束，多生子们也分散开来，哽咽着，仿佛心都要碎了。“再见了，我最亲爱的朋友，弗德保佑你。再见，我最亲爱的朋友。弗德保佑！再见，我最亲爱的朋友……”

　　等到德尔塔都离开后，警察关掉了演说，那天使般的声音也随之消失。

　　“你们是安静地跟我走，还是？”警官问道，指了指他的麻醉枪。

　　“我们安静地跟你走。”野蛮人答道，轻轻擦拭嘴唇上的伤口、擦伤的脖子和被咬伤的左手。

　　亥姆霍兹用手帕捂着不停流血的鼻子，点头表示同意。

　　贝尔纳醒了，腿也有了知觉。他想趁这会没人注意，偷偷溜出去。

　　“喂，你！”警长一声令下，一个戴猪鼻子面具的人快步穿过房间，按住了年轻人的肩膀。

　　贝尔纳转过身来，露出愤怒无辜的表情。逃跑？做梦都没想过要逃跑。“你们找我做什么？”他问那个警官，“我一点儿都不明白。”

　　“你是被抓的那两个人的朋友，对吧？”

　　“呃……”贝尔纳犹豫了，但他不得不承认事实，“对，我不能和他们做朋友吗？”他问。

　　“那就跟我们走吧。”警官说。然后把他们带到了门口停警车的地方。

第26章 (1)


　　三人被带进总统的书房。

　　“总统阁下一会儿就来。”男管家留下他们，自己走了。

　　亥姆霍兹大笑起来。

　　“他想请我们喝咖啡吗？这可不像审讯。”他说完便陷进了奢华的气垫沙发里。“振作点，贝尔纳！”瞧见朋友那张气恼得发绿的脸，他补充道。贝尔纳可振作不起来，他没有搭腔，连看都没有看亥姆霍兹一眼，而是别有用心地选了一张最朴素而不舒服的椅子坐下，暗暗希望这个举动可以缓解总统的愤怒。

　　野蛮人在屋里焦躁地来回踱步，带着模糊的好奇观察着书架上的书、录音带和编号孔里的机械线筒。窗下的桌子上放着一本巨大的书，黑色人造皮封面上印着一个金色大字母“t”。他拿起书翻阅。《我的人生与事业》，我主弗德著，由弗德知识宣传会在底特律出版。他悠闲地翻动书页，这儿看一句，那儿看一段，正准备说书的内容太无趣时，门开了，驻西欧世界总统轻快地走进了房间。

　　穆斯塔法·孟德跟三个人都握了手，却只对野蛮人一个人发话，“野蛮人先生，看样子你不太喜欢我们的文明。”他说。

　　野蛮人看着他。他原本打算说谎，气势汹汹地回答或是干脆绷着脸不说话，但是总统脸上那种诙谐的聪明使他打消了念头，他决定讲实话：“是的，不喜欢。”他摇了摇头。

　　贝尔纳满脸无措和惊恐。总统会怎么想到约翰直截了当地告诉总统不喜欢文明，而自己跟这样的人做朋友，要承担多大的罪名，太可怕了。“等等，约翰……”贝尔纳正要说什么，穆斯塔法·孟德凌厉的一瞥让他卑微地闭上了嘴。

　　野蛮人继续开诚布公地讲，“当然，这里也有很多美好的事物，比如说空中的音乐……”

　　“有时成千的叮叮咚咚的乐器在我耳边鸣响。”总统说。

　　野蛮人忽然容光焕发，惊喜地问：“你也读过莎士比亚的作品？”他问，“我以为在英格兰这种地方没人知道呢。”

　　“几乎没人，我是少数知道的人之一。你明白，这是本禁书。但是我是制定法律的人，自然也可以不遵守，我有豁免权。而马克斯先生，”他转过身对贝尔纳说，“恐怕你不能不遵守。”

　　贝尔纳陷入了绝望的深渊。

　　“为什么是禁书？”野蛮人问道。由于发现一个读过莎士比亚作品的人，他沉浸在兴奋中，暂时忘记了其他一切。

　　总统耸了耸肩，“主要的原因是它太古老了，古旧的东西在我们这里没有用。”

　　“就算它们很美好也没有用？”

　　“就是美好，所以才更没有用。美好的事物充满吸引力，我们不希望人们被老套的东西吸引，他们应该喜欢新事物。”

　　“可是新事物是那么愚蠢和恐怖。那些新话剧毫无内容，只有些飞来飞去的直升飞机和虚拟可感的亲吻。”他做了个鬼脸。“都是羊跟猴子！”只有在《奥赛罗》的世界里他才能为蔑视和仇恨找到合适的词语。

　　“它们是温顺而驯服的动物。”总统喃喃地插话道。

　　“为什么不让他们看《奥赛罗》？”

　　“我已经告诉你了，因为它很古老，再说他们也读不懂。”

　　这倒是真的，他记得亥姆霍兹是怎样嘲笑《罗密欧和朱丽叶》的。“好吧！”停顿了片刻，他说，“弄点像《奥赛罗》一样的新东西，他们能读懂的那种。”

　　“那正是我们想要写的东西。”亥姆霍兹打破了沉默。

　　“那是你永远写不出来的东西。”总统说道，“如果像《奥赛罗》，就没人能读懂，不管它有多新；况且，如果是新东西，就不可能像《奥赛罗》。”

　　“为什么不可能？”

　　“是啊，为什么不可能？”亥姆霍兹重复着，他也忘记了自己所处的危险境地。只有贝尔纳没忘，他绿着脸，满心焦急和顾虑，其他人都忽略了他。“为什么不可能？”

　　“因为我们的世界和《奥赛罗》的世界截然不同。没有钢就造不出汽车，同理，没有社会动荡就写不出悲剧。我们的社会安逸稳定，民众幸福，他们想要什么就有什么，不该得到的东西从不会奢求；他们富裕而安全，没有疾病烦恼，从不畏惧死亡；他们满心喜悦，感受不到激情和衰老；他们无需为父母忧愁，没有妻子、儿女和情人，不会产生强烈的感情。一旦接受了条件设置，就不会超越设定的条件行动。万一出了岔子，还有唆麻来维持安定。对，就是你以自由之名丢到窗外的东西，野蛮人先生，哈哈，自由！”他大笑起来，“想要德尔塔们明白什么是自由，还想让他们读懂《奥赛罗》，你真是个天真的孩子！”

　　野蛮人稍作沉默，固执地坚持道：“无论如何，《奥赛罗》是好的，比任何感官剧都好。”

　　“这是当然，”总统表示同意，“但是我们需要为社会安定付出代价。人们必须在幸福生活和所谓的高雅艺术之间做出选择。最后，我们选择牺牲高雅艺术，以感官剧和芳香风琴来代替。”

　　“可那些东西毫无意义。”

　　“意义在于它们本身为观众带来了愉悦的感官享受。”

　　“但是它们不过是……傻子讲述的故事。”

　　总统大笑道：“你对你的朋友沃森先生很不礼貌啊，他可是最杰出的情感工程师之一。”

　　“约翰说得没错，”亥姆霍兹沮丧地说，“明明没什么可写的，还偏要写，我的确是个傻子。”

　　“正是如此，才需要巨大的创造力。什么都不用，仅仅利用感官就创造出艺术，相当于用最少的钢材去制造一辆汽车。”

　　野蛮人不住摇头：“对我来说太可怕了。”

　　“当然可怕。与苦难所得到的补偿相比，现实的幸福显得格外肮脏；稳定远没有动乱那样跌宕起伏、引人入胜；心满意足的生活不具备与灾难做斗争那种惊心动魄的魅力，也不像与诱惑决斗或是推翻激情和怀疑那样栩栩如生。幸福从来就不是伟大的。”

　　“确实如此。”沉默片刻后，野蛮人说：“但是为什么要创造这些多生子，走到如此糟糕的境地？”他用手擦了擦眼睛，试图擦去装配台前一排排相同面孔的侏儒的身影，擦去那些在布冷特福单轨火车站门口排成长队的多生子的影像，擦去琳达垂死之际在床边爬行的人蛆，擦去攻击者那无穷无尽重复的面孔。他看着缠在左手上的绷带，不由地打起寒战，“太恐怖了！”

　　“但是多生子们极其有用！我知道你不喜欢我们的波卡群，但是我很肯定地告诉你，他们是建立其他一切东西的基础；他们是陀螺仪，稳固国家这架火箭飞机，使其不脱离正常轨道。”那深沉的声音仿佛能够震动心魄，充满激情的手势暗示着整个宇宙和不可抵抗的社会机制洪流，穆斯塔法·孟德的能言善辩几乎达到了合成音乐的制作标准。

　　“我想知道，”野蛮人说着，“既然你从那些瓶子里能够得到任何你想要的东西，为什么你不把每个人培养成阿尔法双加呢？”

　　穆斯塔法·孟德哑然失笑：“因为我们不希望别人割断我们的喉咙，”他答道，“幸福与稳定是我们的信仰。一个仅有阿尔法的社会必然会出现不安定和痛苦。不妨设想一下，如果一家工厂里全都是阿尔法：阿尔法是互相分离、互不联系的个体。他们遗传优秀，条件设置为在一定限制下能够做出自由选择和承担责任。你想象一下吧。”他重复道。

　　野蛮人尝试着去想象，但没想出什么实质性的东西。

　　“结果就是荒谬。一个按照阿尔法标准换瓶、接受阿尔法条件设置的人怎么能干伊普西龙的工作呢，那些半白痴的工作会让他们发狂——对，发狂，或是摔东西。阿尔法并非不能社会化，但是得满足一个条件：让他们做阿尔法的工作。伊普西龙那种牺牲自我奉献社会的行为只能由伊普西龙完成，因为对他们来说，这不是一种自我牺牲。他们是最没有抵抗力的一群人，条件设置决定了他们的人生轨迹，他们只能循着这条路走下去，因为命运早已被决定，不可避免。即使换了瓶，他们仍然被禁锢在一个无形的瓶子里——保持着婴儿或胚胎的生活形态。”“当然，我们每个人都一样。”总统沉吟着说道，“都在瓶子里度过人生。如果有幸生为阿尔法，瓶子相对而言会广阔很多。被关在狭小瓶里的阿尔法，将犹如困兽一般痛苦。这道理很浅显，你不能把高种姓的香槟倒进低种姓的瓶子里。而且我们也在实践中证实了这一点：塞浦路斯实验的结果很有说服力。”

　　“塞浦路斯实验？”野蛮人问。

第27章 (2)


　　穆斯塔法·孟德笑着说：“如果你愿意，可以叫它重新换瓶实验。实验开始于弗德纪元四七三年，当时的总统撤离了塞浦路斯岛上所有居民，让预先选好的两万两千个阿尔法住了进去，给他们配备所有农业和工业设备，让他们自行管理岛屿。结果与理论猜想不谋而合，土地荒芜低产，工厂罢工不断，法律如同虚设，命令不予执行，被分配做低等工作的人用尽心机谋取高等职位，从事高等工作的人互相勾结、不计代价地维护其优势地位。不到六年时间，就爆发了激烈的内战，二万二千人中死去了一万九千人。幸存者一致请愿，要求世界总统恢复对岛屿的统治。这就是结局，史上唯一仅有的阿尔法社会就这样消亡了。

　　野蛮人深深地叹了口气。

　　“按照冰山模式，”穆斯塔法·孟德说，“人口的最佳比例为：九分之八在水下，九分之一在水上。”

　　“在水下的人们幸福吗？”

　　“比水上的人幸福。比如说，比你旁边这两位朋友幸福。”他指着两个阿尔法说。

　　“但他们做着那么可怕的工作。”

　　“可怕？他们可不这么想。相反，他们乐在其中，不仅清闲，还简单得像小孩子的玩意，没有身心负担。七个半小时的体力活不算繁重，之后还能领取唆麻，尽情地游戏、性交和欣赏感官剧。他们别无所求了。”他继续补充，“当然，他们可能会要求缩短工作时间，我们也会满足他们。从技术上讲，可以毫不费力地把低等工种的工作时间缩短为一天三到四个小时。问题是，他们会为此感到更幸福吗？答案是不会。一个半世纪之前，进行了一次实验，将整个爱尔兰岛的工作时间改为一天四小时，结果怎样呢？社会开始动荡，唆麻消费量剧增，仅此而已。三个半小时的额外闲暇远远不能成为幸福的源泉，相反，人们倍感拘束，都选择去度唆麻假日。发明局里有数千份节省劳力的计划案。”穆斯塔法·孟德做了一个手势，强调数量极大。“为什么我们不执行这些方案？是为劳动者着想：过多的闲暇对他们来说是残酷的折磨。不仅是工业，农业上也一样。如果我们愿意，可以人工合成所有食物，但是我们宁愿保留三分之一的农业人口，维护他们的利益，因为从土地上收获食物比工厂制造食物要慢得多。此外，考虑到社会的稳定性，我们避免进行改变，每一次改变都可能威胁社会稳定。这就是为什么我们对采用新发明格外谨慎。纯粹的科学发现具有潜在的颠覆性，有时，甚至得把科学看待为敌人。是的，即使是如此有用的科学。”

　　科学？野蛮人皱起了眉头。他听过这个词，但是究竟是什么，他也说不清楚。莎士比亚和印第安村的老人从未提到过科学，从琳达那里也只了解到几条浅显的线索：科学是用来制造直升飞机的东西，是让玉米舞显得可笑的东西，是让人不长皱纹、不掉牙齿的东西。他竭尽全力想理解总统的意思。

　　“没错，”穆斯塔法·孟德说，“这是为保证稳定而付出的另一个代价。不光是艺术，科学也跟幸福相悖。科学具有危险性，我们必须提防它，给它拴上锁链，戴上口络。”

　　“什么？”亥姆霍兹大吃一惊，“可我们都认为科学就是一切。这是睡眠学习中的陈词滥调。”

　　“每周三次，每次从十三点到十七点。”贝尔纳抓住机会插话。

　　“还有我们在大学里做的宣传……”

　　“对，但是宣传的是哪种科学？”穆斯塔法·孟德尖酸讽刺地说，“你们没有接受过科学训练，所以没法判断。我年轻时是个杰出的物理学家，心地太纯良，根本没意识到我们的科学不过是本烹饪书。谁都不能质疑书上的正统烹饪理论。没有厨师长的特别允许，谁都不能向书中添加新的菜谱。现在我成为了厨师长，但曾经我也是个爱打破沙锅问到底的年轻洗碗工，那时，我依自己的想法，搞一些邪门歪道、不合法的烹饪。其实就是真正的科学。”他沉默了。

　　“那后来呢？”亥姆霍兹·沃森问。

　　总统叹了口气：“几乎和你们这些年轻人一样，我差点被送到一个岛上。”

　　这些话对贝尔纳来说犹如晴空霹雳，刺激他说出不得体的话：“把我送到小岛上？”他从座位上跳了起来，飞快地穿过房间，冲到总统面前手舞足蹈地解释。“你们不能把我送去岛上，我没做过任何坏事，都是他们做的，我发誓是他们做的。”他带着责备的意味指着亥姆霍兹和野蛮人。“我求求您，别送我去冰岛，我保证以后只做分内的事，再给我一次机会，请您再给我一次机会。”眼泪哗哗流出。“听我说，这都是他们的错！”他啜泣着，“别送我去冰岛，我求您，总统阁下，求您了……”他如此卑微落魄，屈着双腿跪倒在总统面前。穆斯塔法·孟德试着扶他起来，但贝尔纳坚持要跪着，“吱吱呀呀”说个没完，最后总统只好按铃召来第四秘书。

　　“带三个人过来，”他命令道，“把马克斯先生带到卧室，给他注射一剂唆麻，让他上床睡一会。”

　　三个穿绿制服的多生子侍从跟从第四秘书进入房间，拉走了仍然在叫喊和啜泣的贝尔纳。

　　门关上时，总统说：“别人肯定以为我要把他的喉咙割掉呢。如果他还有点脑子，应该明白对他的惩罚其实是种奖励。被送到岛上，就能遇到世界上最有趣的男人和女人。那里的人因为种种原因而变得过于独立自主，不能融入集体社会。他们有自己的想法，不喜欢正统观念。几乎每个人都有自己的个性和特点。我几乎要嫉妒你了，沃森先生。”

　　亥姆霍兹大笑着说：“那你为什么不去岛上？”

　　“因为最终我还是更喜欢这里！”总统回答说，“他们当时给我两个选择：被送到岛上，在那里继续搞纯科学研究；或者进入总统委员会，将有机会成功继任总统。我选择了后者，放弃了科学。”一小会儿的沉寂之后，他接着说，“有时候，我为自己放弃科学感到遗憾。幸福是个难伺候的主人，特别是别人的幸福。如果人们没有被设置为毫无疑问地接受幸福，那么幸福远远比真理更难伺候。”他叹着气，又陷入沉默，然后换了一种轻快的语调说，“好吧，职责就是职责，不能为自己的喜好讨价还价。我喜欢科学，爱好真理。但真理威胁社会，科学危害公众。他们是双刃剑，有用但危险。我们利用它实现了历史上最稳定的平衡。跟我们的安稳社会比起来，从前的国家简直是无可救药的动荡；即使是原始社会的母系氏族也比不上我们的稳定。我要再次表达对科学的感谢。但是，我们不能让科学毁掉自己的成果，这就是为什么我们要小心谨慎地限制科学研究范围——也就是为什么我差点被遣送到岛上。科学只能被用来处理目前最紧急的问题，其他任何探索都应刻意回避和遏止。”

　　稍作停顿之后，他说：“有件事很有趣，就是阅读我主弗德时代的人们写下的关于科学进步的书。他们似乎猜想科学可以无视其他限制而无穷无尽地发展。当时，知识是最高尚的品德，真理拥有无上的价值；其他一切都处于次要和附属地位。但观念在慢慢地改变，我主弗德做了很大的努力，将对真理和美丽的追求转变到舒适和幸福。大规模的生产需要这种转变。不同于真和美，众人的幸福是社会齿轮稳定转动的唯一保证。况且，只要群众掌握了政权，幸福就会是最重要的，而非真理和美丽。尽管如此，当时并没有限制科学研究。人们还是把真理和美当做至高的善，继续热切讨论和研究，直到爆发九年战争。九年战争彻底改变了论调。但你身处炭疽炮弹的烟雾之中，那些真理、美和知识又有什么意义？九年战争之后，科学第一次受到控制。那时的人们连食欲都得控制才能生存下去。为了安稳的生活可以做任何事，包括进行多方控制。诚然，我们牺牲了部分真理，却造就了幸福。俗话说有得必有失，要想得到幸福就得付出代价。所以，沃森先生，你现在就得付出代价，因为你碰巧太过追求美丽。我曾经太过追求真理，也付出过代价。”

　　长时间的沉寂，野蛮人打破沉默说：“但你没有被流放到岛上。”

　　总统微笑道：“我付出的代价就是提供幸福，为他人提供，而不是为我自己。”停了一会，他补充道：“你们很幸运，世界上有很多不同的小岛，多到我不知道应该把你们送去哪个岛了。把你们放进毒气室如何？顺便问一下，沃森先生，你喜欢热带气候吗？马库塞斯岛怎样？萨摩亚群岛呢？或是什么让你更心旷神怡的地方？”

　　亥姆霍兹从气垫椅上站了起来，“我宁愿去气候恶劣的地方，”他回答说：“气候越恶劣，我越有可能写出好作品。最好时常有一些狂风暴雨。”

　　总统充满赞许地点头：“沃森先生，我很欣赏你的精神。欣赏的程度不亚于我站在总统立场上反对它的程度。”他笑着，“弗兰克群岛怎样？”

　　“这主意不错，”亥姆霍兹回答说。“现在，如果你不介意，我想去看看可怜的贝尔纳。”

第28章


　　“艺术、科学……你们似乎为幸福付出了很高的代价。”只剩两人时，野蛮人问：“还牺牲了别的什么吗？”

　　“当然还有宗教。”总统回答说。“九年战争之前，曾经有些被称为上帝的东西。我基本都忘了，你知道关于神的一切，对吧？”

　　“嗯……”野蛮人犹豫了。他本想说说寂寞、夜晚、月下苍白的山坡、从悬崖上堕入黑暗和死亡，他想畅所欲言，却找不到合适的词，即使在莎士比亚的世界里也找不到。

　　总统走到屋子另一边，打开一个嵌在书架隔墙间的大保险柜。厚重的柜门晃动着打开，总统在黑暗的柜子里翻寻着什么。“我曾经对这个课题很感兴趣，”他说着，搬出了一本黑色的厚书，“没读过这本书吧？”

　　野蛮人接过书，大声朗读书名——“《圣经：新旧约全书》。”

　　“这本呢，也没读过吧？”他拿出一本已丢失封面的小书。

　　“《效法基督》。”

　　“这本也是。”他又递过一本。

　　“《宗教经验种种》，威廉·詹姆士著。”

　　“我还有很多这样的书，”穆斯塔法·孟德接着说，“一整套肮脏古旧的书。看，上帝在保险柜里，弗德在书架上。”他大笑着指着他所谓的图书馆：一排排书柜，摆得满满的阅读机线圈和录音带盘。

　　“既然你知道上帝，为什么不告诉他们？”野蛮人愤愤不平地问，“为什么不让他们读关于上帝的书？”

　　“和禁止《奥赛罗》的理由一样：太过古老。它们记载着成百上千年前的上帝，而不是现在的上帝。”

　　“但是上帝不会变。”

　　“人却会变。”

　　“那又有什么问题？”

　　“天大的问题。”穆斯塔法·孟德说，他又站了起来，走向保险柜，“从前有个叫纽曼的人，”他说，“是个红衣主教，”他补充道，“还是那种社区一流的歌唱家。”

　　“哦，红衣主教潘杜尔夫，来自迷人的米兰，我在莎士比亚的作品里读到过。”

　　“对，你肯定读到过。嗯，我刚刚说到有个纽曼主教，这是他写的书。”他抽出书本，“既然要谈这本书，还得说说另一本，德·拜伦写的。他是个哲学家——如果你知道哲学家是什么的话。”

　　“是那种梦想不多的人，想的东西比天地间的事物少得多。”野蛮人马上回答。

　　“对。现在我就给你读一段确实由他梦想出来的东西，听听这位古代一流歌唱家说的话。”他翻到夹着小纸条的那一页读起来：“我们对自己的支配远比不上对拥有物的支配。我们不是自己的主人，而是上帝的财产。因为我们既没有创造自己，也不能超越自己。这样看待问题，难道不会更加幸福吗？从属于自己又能得到什么慰藉和幸福呢？富有的青年才俊可能不这么想，他们认为按照自己的设想和方法做事很伟大，可以不依赖任何人，不用顾虑视野之外的风景，没有不停认知、不停祈祷、不停询问他人的烦恼。但是随着岁月流逝，他们会和其他人一样，发现人类本不应该独立——独立是一种不自然的状态。维持一段时间独立固然可能，但不能让我们安然走到生命尽头。”穆斯塔法·孟德停下来，放下第一本书，翻开第二本，“以这一段为例，”他打开低沉的嗓音读起来：“人总是要老的；随着年月的增长，会强烈地感觉到脆弱、疲惫和不安。为了平息这种恐怖的感觉，他会想象自己病了，告诉自己这种窘境来源于某些特殊原因，和疾病一样是可以克服和痊愈的。但这是徒劳无用的遐想！他们患上的是名为‘衰老’的可怕疾病。有人说，驱使老年人依附宗教的正是对死亡和死后世界的恐惧。但我的自身体验让我坚信：宗教感情与此类恐惧或遐想并没有联系，而是随着年龄的增长而增长。年轻时理智总是被想象、欲望和妄想扰乱，当岁月磨平了激情，消钝了想象力和敏感度，理智就能够不受干扰地活动。有如拨开云雾见青天，上帝出现在面前。我们的灵魂看到、感觉到光明的源头，并向它靠近过去，那么自然而不可避免。从此，寄予感官世界的生命和魅力开始离我们而去；从此，那些非凡的存在不再受到内在或外在印象的支撑。我们需要依靠一些持续存在、不会欺骗我们的东西——现实，一种纯粹而永恒的真理。是的，对上帝的依附是不可避免的。因为宗教情绪的本质是那么纯净，带给灵魂的感受是那么愉悦，几乎弥补了所有的失落。”

　　穆斯塔法·孟德合上书，整个人靠在椅背上。“天地间有千千万万哲学家想象不到的事，比如说我们。（他挥开手臂）我们这个现代化的世界。‘拥有青春和财富才能独立于上帝，独立并不能让人安然走到生命尽头。’而现在的我们，恰恰拥有青春和财富并安然走到最后。结论很明显，我们能够独立于上帝。‘宗教感情将抚慰我们所有的失落\"，可我们从未感到失落，不需要抚慰。宗教感情是累赘的。既然青春的欲望永不熄灭，为何要寻求欲望的代替品？既然古老单纯的活动能让人尽情享受，为何要寻求娱乐的替代品？既然在日常活动中保持身心愉快，休息又有何用？既然唆麻能安抚我们的情绪，安慰又有何用？既然社会平稳有序，永恒不变的依赖又有何用？”

　　“所以说，你认为上帝不存在？”

　　“那倒不是，我认为应该是存在的。”

　　“为什么……”

　　穆斯塔法·孟德制止了提问，“在不同人面前，上帝具有不同的形态。现代化社会到来之前，上帝表现出这本书中描述的形态。而现在……”

　　“现在是什么形态？”野蛮人问。

　　“虚无。就像从未存在过。”

　　“这都怪你们。”

　　“不，这都怪文明。机械、医学和普遍的幸福不容许神的存在。这是个艰难的选择。我们的文明选择了机械、医学和幸福。正因如此，这些书被锁在保险柜里。它们太过肮脏，会让人觉得不舒服……”

　　野蛮人打断了他：“感受到上帝存在不是自然而然的吗？”

　　“你怎么不问，穿裤子拉拉链是自然而然的吗？”总统讽刺地说：“说到这，我想起一个叫布拉德利的老家伙，他认为哲学就是为人类出于本能相信的东西找一个糟糕的理由。好像人类生来就有信仰似的。人相信什么是由条件设置决定的。因为某些糟糕的理由而产生信仰，然后又去寻找新的糟糕理由，这就是哲学。人们信仰上帝，是因为他们被设置为有这种信仰。

　　“尽管如此，”野蛮人坚持说，“当你感到孤独——特别是在夜晚思考死亡时，会自然地想到上帝。”

　　“如今世界可没有孤独的人，”穆斯塔法·孟德说，“我们教他们憎恨孤独；况且，他们的生活早已被设置好，没有感受孤独的空隙。”

　　野蛮人沮丧地点了点头。在马尔佩斯，人们冷眼拒绝他参与印第安人集体活动，他深受孤独之苦；在文明都市伦敦，他逃离不开日日夜夜的社交活动，找不到安静与孤独，还是深深的痛苦。

　　“不知你是否记得《李尔王》中的一段话，”野蛮人沉默许久后终于说话。“‘公正的天神将我们的风流罪过化作惩罚我们的工具；他在黑暗淫邪的地方生下了你，结果丧失了他的眼睛。’你记得吗，当时艾德蒙受了伤，在垂死边缘回答，‘你说得不错；天道的车轮已经循环过来了。’这说的难道不正是扬善惩恶的上帝吗？”

　　“哦？是这样吗？”总统反问道，“即使你跟一个不孕的淫妇肆意放荡风流，也没有什么风险，不会有儿子的情妇来挖你的眼睛。‘天道的车轮循环，我就在这儿。’如果艾德蒙生在今日会怎样？坐在气垫椅里，揽着美女的腰，一边嚼性激素口香糖一边看感官剧。天神当然是公正的，但是神的法典由社会的高层组织者来传播执行。神要遵从人的指令。”

　　“你确定吗？”野蛮人问道：“你真有把握说，坐在气垫椅里的艾德蒙没有像那个受伤濒死的艾德蒙一样遭受严重的惩罚？公正的天神难道不会因为他的淫乱风流而让他堕落吗？

　　“为什么要惩罚他？一个快乐开朗、勤奋工作、合理消费的完美公民？当然，如果你采用不同的判断标准，可以认为他堕落了。但是人们得遵循同一套原则，不能玩着电磁高尔夫，却用着调皮狗离心球的规则。”

　　“但是价值不取决于个人的意愿。”野蛮人说：“首先它本身得有宝贵之处，然后需要评判人承认它的珍贵，才能得到肯定和尊重。”

　　“行了，行了！”穆斯塔法·孟德抗议道，“我们离题千里了。”

　　“如果你想到上帝，就不会允许自己堕入邪恶的深渊。你会在信念的支持下坚强地忍耐、勇敢地处事。我在印第安人身上看到了这一切。”

　　“你看到过这些，我相信。”穆斯塔法·孟德说。“但是我们不是印第安人，没有必要让文明人忍受磨难和困苦。至于勇敢处事——这种观念为弗德所禁止。如果各行其是、肆意而为，社会秩序将荡然无存。”

　　“那克己精神呢？如果信仰上帝，就有了克制自己的理由。”

　　“只有消除克己观念，工业文明才能长存。为了社会齿轮的顺利运转，我们需要自我放纵，越放纵越好，直到健康与经济无法承受。

　　“有了上帝，你们会洁身自爱！”野蛮人有些脸红地说。

　　“贞洁意味着热情和神经衰弱，两者都意味着不稳定，不稳定意味着文明的终止。文明的长久依赖于淫邪放荡。”

　　“一切高贵、美好和英勇的事物都依赖于上帝的存在，如果你们信仰上帝……”

　　“亲爱的孩子，”穆斯塔法·孟德说：“你得知道，高贵和英勇的事物对我们的文明没有意义。这些东西都意味着政策的低效。我们的社会井然有序、组织严密，没有人有机会成为高贵之人或英雄。只有社会动荡不稳，才能产生这种机会。高贵和英勇的品质什么时候能显现作用？战火绵延时、人心分裂时、抵抗诱惑时、保护所爱之人并为之奋斗时。但是现在没有任何战争；最需要防范遏止的是对某人太过依恋。没有观念分歧和人心分裂；每个人都被设置为做好自己分内的事。没有任何诱惑需要抵抗，因为要做的事情总是很愉快，又可以肆意放纵原始的冲动。就算不幸发生让人不悦的事情，还能依靠唆麻无忧无虑地度个假，忘记现实的烦恼。唆麻还能平息怒火，化解敌对与争执，增加耐心和忍耐力。过去，人们需要付出极大努力，经过数年的精神训练才能达到这点，而现在，吞下两三片半克唆麻足矣。任何人都可以轻易变得高尚。一瓶唆麻能装下至少一半分量的美德。可以说，唆麻就是没有眼泪的基督教。”

　　“眼泪是必不可少的。难道你不记得《奥赛罗》里的话？‘要是每一次暴风雨之后，都有这样和煦的阳光，那么尽管让狂风肆意地吹，把死亡都吹醒吧！’有个印第安老人讲过一个故事，主角是个叫玛特莎吉的姑娘，想娶她的年轻小伙子必须到她的园子里干一上午的农活。这个任务看起来轻而易举，但是园子里有许多有魔力的苍蝇和蚊子。几乎没有人能够忍受蚊虫的叮咬，除了一个小伙子，他最终赢得了美人的芳心。”

　　“好个精彩的故事！但是在文明的国度，”总统说，“不用干农活就能拥有美丽的姑娘，也没有苍蝇蚊子的骚扰。我们早在几个世纪前就消灭了蚊虫。”

　　野蛮人双眉紧蹙地点了点头：“你们消灭了蚊虫。的确，这很像你们的处事方式。消灭一切不愉快的事物，而不会学着去忍受。‘是否应默默地忍受坎坷命运的暴虐毒箭，还是应该拿起武器与苍茫苦海愤然为敌。’结果你们两者都没有选择，既不选择忍受，也不选择对抗，而是直接废止了毒箭，如此简单。”

　　他忽然沉默无语，想起了母亲。在三十七层的房间里，琳达漂浮在歌声的海洋中，有璀璨的光辉，有芳香的抚慰。她漂浮而去，脱离了空间，脱离了时间，脱离了苦涩回忆、陈年旧习、臃肿身躯的牢狱。至于托马金，曾经的培育及条件设置主任，现在还在度唆麻假日——这是他逃避屈辱和痛苦的唯一手段。在那个世界，他听不到冷言冷语，听不到尖酸嘲讽，看不到狰狞面孔，感觉不到两只松弛潮湿的手臂搭在自己的臂膀。那是一个美妙的世界……

　　“你们需要改变，”野蛮人继续，“需要创造些带来眼泪的东西。这儿的东西都没有眼泪值钱。”

　　（当野蛮人这么提议时，亨利·福斯特曾经抗议说：“一千二百五十万美元，是新条件设置中心的造价，一分都不少。”）

　　“‘为了一个颗粒不收的弹丸之地，敢于面对死亡和一切没有把握的事情，面对命运、死亡与危险。’从这里面难道得不到什么启发吗？”他抬头凝视着穆斯塔法·孟德，“与上帝无关——当然上帝也可能是理由之一。危险的生活难道没有什么好处吗？”

　　“好处很多，”总统回答，“所以男男女女都应该时不时刺激一下肾上腺。”

　　“什么？”野蛮人一头雾水。

　　“这是确保完全健康的条件之一。所以我们才强制推行v.p.s治疗。”

　　“v.p.s治疗？”

　　“激情替代治疗，每月定时执行一次。我们向身体各个系统注入肾上腺激素。这样，可以在生理上达到与恐惧和狂怒相同的效果。这个治疗能够迅速补充激情，程度不亚于杀死苔丝狄蒙娜和被奥赛罗杀死时的情绪波动，还没有任何不方便。”

　　“与之相比，我更喜欢不方便。”

　　“我们不一样，”总统说，“我们更青睐舒舒服服办事。”

　　“我不渴求舒适，我渴求上帝，渴求诗歌，渴求真正的危险，渴求自由，渴求善良，渴求罪恶。”

　　“实际上，你在要求遭受苦难的权利。”穆斯塔法·孟德说。

　　“那好，”野蛮人挑衅地说，“我现在要求遭受苦难。”

　　“你还没有提到衰老、丑陋和阳痿的权利，患梅毒、癌症的权利，匮乏、饥饿的权利，惹人厌恶的权利，无时无刻不在惧怕未来的权利，患伤寒的权利，承受难以名状的折磨的权利。”许久的沉默冻结了空气。

　　“我要求这一切。”野蛮人最后说。

　　穆斯塔法·孟德耸耸肩：“那就如你所愿。”

第29章 (1)


　　贝尔纳和亥姆霍兹走进半开的门。

　　“约翰！”

　　浴室里传出来了野蛮人特有的声音，其中明显夹杂着几分不畅快。

　　“怎么回事？”亥姆霍兹高声询问。

　　没人回答。不畅快的声音紧接着又重复了两次，而后是一片寂静。

　　片刻后，浴室的门“咔嗒”一声打开了，野蛮人脸色苍白地走出来。

　　“我说，”亥姆霍兹担心地说：“你肯定是生病了，约翰！”

　　“是不是吃了什么不好消化的东西？”贝尔纳问道。

　　野蛮人点点头。“我把‘文明’吞下了肚。”

　　“什么？”

　　“我中了它的毒，染了它的污浊。然后，”他压低嗓子说，“我还吞了自己的‘邪恶’。”

　　“好吧，不过你究竟……我的意思是说，刚才你……”

　　“我已经洗净了灵魂，”野蛮人说，“刚刚我喝了芥末水。”

　　两个人都目瞪口呆地看着他：“你是故意这么折腾自己的？”贝尔纳问道。

　　“印第安人就是用这种方法来净化身心的。”野蛮人坐了下来，叹了口气，抹了抹额头。“我得休息一会，”他说，“我真的很累。”

　　“嗯，累是肯定的。”亥姆霍兹寻思了片刻说道，“我们是来道别的。”他用另外一种声调说，“明天一早就出发。”

　　“对，我们明天就走了。”贝尔纳说，从他的脸上，野蛮人察觉出一种屈服于命运的决心。“还有，约翰，”贝尔纳坐了下来，身子前倾，手放在野蛮人的膝盖上，“我想说，关于昨天发生的一切我深感歉疚。”他的脸刷地红了，“我很惭愧！”尽管他的声音听着起伏不定，但他还是说了下去，“我真的非常……”

　　野蛮人突然打断了他，亲切地握紧了他的手。

　　“亥姆霍兹对我很好，”贝尔纳停顿了一会，说：“如果不是他，我早就……”

　　“够了，够了。”亥姆霍兹抗议道。

　　一阵沉默。此时大家都很伤感，因为他们都彼此爱护——正因如此，三个年轻人又释怀了。

　　“今天早上，我去见了总统。”野蛮人终于开口打破沉默。

　　“去干什么？”

　　“问他是否能让我和你们去一个岛。”

　　“他怎么说？”亥姆霍兹急切地问。

　　野蛮人摇了摇头：“他不准。”

　　“为什么？”

　　“他想继续这个试验。但是我绝对不会配合的！”野蛮人突然暴怒了：“他妈的，我才不做他的试验品，就算全世界所有的总统来找我，我也不会屈服。明天我就走人。”

　　“可是你能去哪里呢？”两人异口同声地问。

　　野蛮人耸了耸肩。“哪儿都行，我不在乎。让我孤孤单单就好。”

　　从吉尔福德到朴茨茅斯的下行路线是途经韦峡谷到达戈德尔明，穿过米尔福德、威特利和黑斯尔米尔，再从彼得斯菲尔德挺进目的地。上行线路基本和这条路平行，需穿过沃普赖斯顿、东哈姆、帕特纳姆、爱斯特德和格雷舒特。这两条路线都分布在拱脊山和鹿头谷之间，有几处距离很近的地方，相隔不到六七公里。对于某些粗心大意的飞行员来说，这距离近得过于危险了，特别是在夜里服用了一克唆麻后。这个地带曾经出现几起严重的事故。曾有人打算将上行路线向西挪几公里。因此，在格雷舒特和东哈姆之间修建了四座空中灯塔，照亮朴茨茅斯到伦敦的航程。如今已经废弃了。灯塔顶上是一片荒寂的天空。而塞尔伯恩、伯顿和法纳姆的上空，则有直升飞机不停地盘旋和轰鸣。

　　野蛮人选择了旧灯塔作为隐居地，地点位于帕特纳姆和埃尔斯特德中间的山顶上。建筑是钢筋水泥铸成的，至今还算牢固。野蛮人最初考察这个地方时，觉得过于舒适了，可以说是现代文明中的奢华之地。因此，他发誓要更加严格自律、诚心忏悔，以洗涤罪恶和抚慰良心。在隐居地度过的第一个夜晚，他坚忍着一夜未眠。他长时间跪地祷告，就像愧疚的克劳迪斯祈祷得到宽恕一样，时而用祖尼语向阿瓮纳威龙祷告，时而又向基督和菩公祷告，还向他的守护神灵——老鹰祈祷。他不时地平伸双臂，就像被钉在了十字架上，然后长时间保持姿势，直到手臂渐渐变得酸痛、颤抖，疼到难以忍受。他自愿承受着十字架苦刑，忍痛咬紧牙关（此时，那不断渗出的汗水也顺势往下淌着），不时地挤出几句话来：“啊，请宽恕我吧！啊，请净化我吧！啊，请助我保持善良！”他一遍又一遍地重复，直到痛得临近晕厥。

　　晨曦时分，他觉得自己已经获得了定居灯塔的权利；尽管大部分窗户上镶着玻璃，但是从瞭望台上看出去，那风景着实优美怡人。对于他来说，选择到灯塔隐居的理由，几乎成为他要另寻他处的原因。之所以选择灯塔，是因为这里风景如画，仿佛可以看到上帝那无形的圣体。可是，他又算得了什么人物，有资格每天、每小时都享受美妙的风景，和上帝的圣体生活在一起？他只配住在肮脏的猪棚或漆黑的地洞。熬过一夜之后，他仍浑身僵硬酸疼，但也是这种疼痛让他觉得良心稍安。他爬上塔顶的瞭望台，观赏着这个被明媚日出照亮的世界，他欣然授予自己在此居住的资格。他的视线被北面拱脊山那绵延的白垩山脉挡住了，群山东边尽头的后方矗立着七座摩天大楼，标志着吉尔福德。野蛮人看着那些大楼露出苦涩的表情。但是随着时间的推移，他不得不与它们和谐相处。在夜里，它们有时像几何形的星星般喜气洋洋地眨着眼睛，有时像发出火焰光芒的手指，庄严地指向那深不可测的神秘天堂。那手势的意义，整个英格兰除了野蛮人之外，恐怕再也没人能体会。

　　灯塔矗立的小山和拱脊山之间是个峡谷，里面有个不起眼的小村落，叫帕特纳姆，一共有九层，有竖井，有家禽农场，还有一个维他命d小工厂。灯塔的南面是一个长长的斜坡，上面开满了杜鹃花，地势向下延伸，通向一连串的池塘。

　　池塘后森林的上空，十四层楼高的埃尔斯特德大楼拔地而起。英格兰典型的昏暗阴霾天气让鹿头谷和塞尔伯恩若隐若现。但是，吸引野蛮人来到这座灯塔的并非朦胧的远景，近处的风景也同样充满诱惑。葱郁的森林，绵延的杜鹃花，鲜艳的金雀花，还有一片片苏格兰冷杉。在那碧波荡漾的池塘上，桦树的枝条探出手来轻抚水面，池塘中的睡莲和灯芯草安然摇曳，这些景色都太美了，对于早已习惯了美洲沙漠的干涸双眼来说，此等美景太过震撼心灵。而且，这是个人迹罕至的地方。许多天来，他却始终没见过一个人影。坐飞机从切林t字形塔楼到灯塔只需一刻钟，但是萨里的荒原比马尔佩斯的群山还要荒僻。每天蜂拥着离开伦敦的人群目标往往是电磁高尔夫球和网球。帕特纳姆没有高尔夫球场，而最近的黎曼网球场在吉尔福德。这儿最迷人的东西就是鲜花和美景。所以，如果没有特别的理由，基本不会有人来这里。野蛮人度过了一段不受打扰、与世无争的时光。

　　他初到伦敦时曾领取过一笔生活费，大部分都花在了装备上面了。离开伦敦前，他买了四张纤维胶羊毛毯、绳子和线、五金件、胶水、必要工具、火柴（不过他打算以后做个火钻）、锅碗瓢盆、两打盒装的种子以及十公斤小麦粉。“不，不要人工合成淀粉和废棉替代面粉。”他曾态度坚决地说，“多营养都不要。”但是，面对着腺素饼干和维他命化牛肉替代品时，他没能拒绝店主的劝诱。看着买来的一盒盒罐头，他为自己的懦弱而自责。这些可憎的文明产品！他下定决心，即使饿到不行，也永远不吃这些东西。“这样会给他们一些教训”，他怀恨地想。但这也会给他自己一些教训。

　　他数了数剩下的钱，希望仅有的这点钱足够让他度过寒冷的冬天。等到明年春天的时候，他的菜园里就会收获足够的粮食，让他脱离外面的世界，开始独立的生活。再说还能捕猎。他曾看到过很多野兔，池塘那边也有很多水禽。他立即开始做起弓箭来。

　　灯塔附近有很多白杨树，灌木丛中也长满了漂亮笔直的榛树树苗，这些都是做箭杆的好材料。他先试着折断一棵白杨树的树苗，然后砍下了六英尺长的没有枝丫的树干，一刀一刀地削掉了树皮，刮掉白色的树痂，按照老米西玛所教他的方法，削出一根和他一样高的杆子，中间的部分很粗很硬，保证弓的结实，两端偏细，便于增加韧性。这项工作让他乐在其中。在伦敦，无论做什么都不需要自己动手，如果想要任何东西，只需按下按钮或是转一下把手。经历过无所事事的文明生活后，这种需要技术和耐心去完成的工作给约翰带来一种纯粹的快乐。

　　当他快要将杆子削成型时，他突然意识到自己在唱歌——唱歌！就好像他从外面回来时，恰好撞上自己在干坏事。他觉得自己的行为简直罪大恶极，愧疚得涨红了脸。毕竟，他来这里并不是为了唱歌和享受，而是为了躲避文明社会的污泥，为了净化受玷污的自己，为了积极地赎罪。他惊愕地意识到，在他专心致志做弓箭的时候，竟然完全忘记了许下的誓言。他曾发誓要永远记得可怜的琳达，记得自己对她致命的伤害，记得那些无视琳达的死亡、像成群虱子般爬来爬去的多生子。这些场景不仅是对他的悲伤和忏悔的嘲讽，更是对神灵的侮辱。他发誓会记得这一切，发誓要永不止息地赎罪。可现在他却高高兴兴地坐在这里做弓箭，还唱起歌来，居然还唱歌……

　　他走进屋里，打开芥末酱，掺上水，在炉火上煮起来。

　　半小时后，三个同一波卡小组的德尔塔减农民碰巧从帕特纳姆驱车驶往爱斯特德，到达山顶的时候，发现一个年轻人站在荒废的灯塔外，正在用带有绳结的鞭子抽打自己，背上烙下一条条鲜红的鞭印，每一鞭下去，都有血淌出来。卡车司机停下车，和两个同伴一起盯着这不可思议的场面，目瞪口呆。一下，两下，三下，他们在数鞭打的次数。在第八下之后，年轻人停下了自我鞭笞，跑到树林边激烈地呕吐，之后又回来抓起鞭子使劲地抽打。九下，十下，十一，十二……

　　“弗德啊！”那个司机小声惊呼，其他两个多生子也发出了同样的惊呼。

　　“我主弗德啊！”他们喊道。

　　三天之后，像是土耳其秃鹰发现了尸体一样，记者们纷纷而至。

　　通过慢火的烘烤和硬化，弓箭做好了。野蛮人忙着做箭杆。三十只榛树树枝也已经被削好、烘干，他小心地在前端镶上了锋利的箭头。一天深夜，他在帕特纳姆的家禽农场发起了一次突袭，所得到的羽毛足以装饰整个武器库的弓箭。当他给弓箭加装羽毛的时候，第一个记者找到了他。记者穿着一双气垫无声鞋，悄然出现在他身后。

　　“哈罗！野蛮人先生！”他说，“我是《准点播报》的记者。”

　　仿佛被毒蛇咬了一口，野蛮人惊得跳了起来，弓箭、羽毛、胶水壶和刷子散落一地。

　　“对不起，吓到您了，”记者诚恳地道歉，“我不是故意的……”他碰了一下头上的帽子——那是一顶铝制的大礼帽，上边装着无线电接收器和发射器。“请原谅我不能脱帽行礼，”他说，“这帽子有些重。好了，正如我刚才所说，我代表《准点播报》……”

　　“你想干什么？”野蛮人戒备地盯着他。那记者又换上了谄媚的笑脸。

　　“呃，是这样，我们的读者对您很感兴趣……”他向一边侧了侧头，那笑容几乎是在卖弄风情，“我们想采访您，说个只言片语就好。”他熟练地将两根电线连接到腰间捆着的便携式电池上，又将它们插到铝制礼帽的两侧，按压帽子一侧的弹簧，天线“哧”地伸出来，又触碰另一侧的弹簧，话筒像惊奇盒里的小丑一样跳出来，悬挂在他鼻子前六英寸的地方摆来摆去。他将耳机架在耳朵上，按下帽子左边的按钮，只听里边传来了一阵黄蜂的嗡鸣；再转动帽子右边的把手，嗡鸣被一阵“呼哧呼哧”“吱吱咯咯”的声音取代。“喂，”他对着话筒说。“喂，喂……”这一系列动作一蹴而就，无比神速。突然，帽子里响起了一阵铃声：“埃兹尔，是你么？我是普利莫·梅隆。我找到野蛮人先生了，他即将拿起话筒说上几句，野蛮人先生，可以开始么？”他抬起头来看着野蛮人，脸上挂上了另外一种胜利般的笑容。“请告诉我们的读者您为什么会来到这里？为什么与都市伦敦不辞而别？（别挂机，埃兹尔！）当然，还想谈谈您鞭打自己的事儿。”（野蛮人愣了一下，他们怎么知道抽鞭子的事？）“我们对此非常好奇。然后不妨再谈谈文明生活。对于这些，您都是很清楚的，最好能说说‘对于文明姑娘的看法’。麻烦您给我们讲两句，哪怕是几个词……”

　　野蛮人按照他的建议说了五个词，一个词一个词地往外蹦。就是之前对贝尔纳说过的，评价坎特伯雷首席歌唱家的那几个词——“哈尼！松斯—唉索—切—纳！”他抓住了记者的肩膀，强扭过180度（这个年轻人出门前用心打扮了一番，穿得很时髦），瞄准目标，使出足球冠军才有的力气和技术，漂亮地一脚将他踹飞。

　　八分钟后，最新一期的《准点播报》新鲜出炉，在伦敦的大街小巷滚烫发售。头版标题赫然在目：“《准点播报》记者尾椎骨惨遭神秘野人踢伤，轰动萨里。”

第30章 (2)


　　“哈，还轰动了伦敦。”记者回来读到这篇文章时想道。但他的骨头也被“轰动”得挺厉害，连坐下吃饭都得小心翼翼，生怕触到痛处。

　　他受伤的事件并没有吓倒兢兢业业的记者同僚，另外四个来自《纽约时报》、《法兰克福四维联合报》、《弗德箴言科学报》和《德尔塔镜报》的记者在当天下午就拜访了灯塔野人，无一例外受到了更加残暴的“接待”。

　　跑到安全距离之后，《弗德箴言科学报》的记者一边揉受伤的屁股一边喊：“无知的混小子！吃了唆麻不就没烦恼了嘛。”

　　“滚远点！”野蛮人晃了晃拳头。

　　对方往后退了几步，又转身说：“服用几克唆麻后，你就会发现，坏事根本就不存在。”

　　“阔哈克瓦，伊雅托奇呀伊！”声音中充满了嘲笑和威胁。

　　“疼痛将会变成幻觉。”

　　“哦，是么？”野蛮人边说边捡起了一根粗大的榛树树干，大步走上前。

　　《弗德箴言科学报》的记者狼狈地冲回直升飞机里，躲了起来。

　　那之后，野蛮人的生活恢复了片刻平静。随后，几架直升飞机停到灯塔上空好奇地盘旋。野蛮人拉起弓，瞄准离他最近的那架纠缠不休的飞机，一箭击穿了机舱的铝地板，尖叫声划破长空，然后飞机调动了最大马力，像火箭发射般冲向云霄。之后，其他的飞机都在远处盘旋，不敢越雷池半步。他无视它们讨厌的轰鸣声（他把自己想象为玛特莎吉少女的追求者，坚定不移地忍受长翅害虫的骚扰），专心开垦着他未来的菜园。过了一阵，那些害虫明显看腻了种菜的野人，一个个飞走了。天空恢复了明朗和安宁，只听见百灵鸟的歌唱。

　　天气闷得让人喘不上气来，空中电闪雷鸣。他整个上午都在锄地，现在伸展四肢躺在地上休息。突然，列宁娜的身影出现在脑海中，赤裸着身体，真切可感。她只穿着鞋袜，周身散发着香气，对他说“亲爱的！”，“搂着我！”那个不要脸的淫妇！可是，哦！她的手臂环上他的脖子，她起伏的胸脯和红唇近在眼前！永恒只在口中和眼里。列宁娜……不，不，不！他跳了起来，半裸着身体跑出了屋子。杜鹃花的尽头处是一片灰白的杜松林。他猛地冲过去抱住那些枝干，绿色的松针刺向他的怀中，代替了他欲念中的那个光滑细腻的肉体。锐利的松针无情地刺痛了他。他努力回想可怜的琳达，想起她呼吸困难到说不出话，想起她紧握着他的双手和那难以形容的恐惧眼神。他曾发誓要永远记住可怜的琳达，但是萦绕在他脑海、不断折磨着他的身影依旧是列宁娜，那个他发誓要永远忘记的列宁娜。即使承受着针扎般的苦痛，他蜷缩的肉体还是无法控制地感受着列宁娜，那么真切。“甜心，甜心……我如此渴求你，如果你也渴求我，还等什么……”

　　鞭子就挂在了门边的钉子上，本来是用于“迎接”记者的。野蛮人疯狂地冲回屋，解下鞭子朝自己挥舞起来，绳结深深地嵌到他的肉里。

　　“婊子！婊子！”他每抽一下就大喊一声，就好像是在抽打列宁娜（他近乎疯狂地希望自己在抽打她），那个白皙、温暖、芳香、邪恶的列宁娜。“婊子！”随后，他用绝望的语气说：“琳达，原谅我。上帝，原谅我。我有罪。我是恶人……不，不！你这个婊子，你这个婊子！”

　　三百米外，来自感官摄制厂的摄影大师达尔文·波拿巴藏在他小心搭起来的树木遮蔽物后目睹了这整个过程。他的耐心和技巧终于得到了回报。他在一棵假橡树的树干中待了三天，在杜鹃花丛中趴了三个晚上，把麦克风藏在金雀花丛中，电线埋在了松软的灰沙里。七十二小时的艰苦磨难换来了这个荣耀的时刻——继他拍完那部叫好又叫座的感官剧《黑猩猩的婚礼》后最伟大的时刻。达尔文·波拿巴在他的摄影设备中爬行，拍下这所有的一切。“太棒了！”当野蛮人开始这一幕惊人的表演时，他自言自语道。“无与伦比！”他用望远镜照相机小心地对焦，镜头紧紧跟着移动着的目标。他调到更大的功率，拍下野蛮人扭曲狂乱的脸部特写（好极了）。按下转换按钮，使用慢镜头拍摄了半分钟（他很肯定这会产生绝妙的喜剧效果）；同时，听那鞭笞声、痛苦的呻吟、狂野的咆哮，都被录进了胶片旁边的录音带上，他尝试了声音加大的效果（天啊，无可置疑的精彩），能清楚听到叫声的间隙中，穿插着百灵鸟的欢叫；如果野蛮人能转过身去该有多好，就能给他血迹斑斑的背部一个完美的特写了——就在这一刻，野蛮人无比配合的转过身（真是难以置信的好运），让他的拍摄毫无缺憾。

　　“啧啧，简直太完美了！”拍摄结束后他不禁夸耀起自己，“太完美了！”他擦了擦脸上的尘土。只要把这些镜头拿到感官剧工作室，加上感官特效，一定会成为跨时代的伟大剧目。达尔文·波拿巴想，这简直可以和《抹香鲸的爱情生活》媲美了。弗德啊！未来多么美好！

　　十二天后，《萨里的野蛮人》公映了，在西欧所有豪华剧院里都可以切身看到、听到、感觉到这个震人心魄的故事。

　　达尔文·波拿巴的新片造成了巨大的反响和效果，公映次日的下午和晚上，约翰在穷乡僻巷的安逸与孤独被一群乘着飞机闻风而来的不速之客彻底破灭。

　　当时，他正在菜园里挖掘，也在他脑海中挖掘，努力寻找思想的本质。死亡——他一下又一下的挥动着铁锹，没有停歇。我们所有的昨天，不过替傻子们照亮了到死亡的土壤中去的路。他正思考的时候，响起了一声惊雷。他又铲起了一铁锹的泥土。琳达为何而死？为什么要让她一点点、一点点丧失做人的尊严，最后变成……他打了一个寒战。一块可亲可吻的腐肉。他把脚踏在铁锹上狠狠地压实土地。葛罗斯特说：“天神掌握着我们的命运，正像顽童捉到飞虫一样，为了戏弄的缘故而把我们杀害。”又一声惊心的轰雷。这是千真万确的道理，比真理本身还要真实。但是，同样也是葛罗斯特将天神称作仁慈的神明。睡眠是你所渴慕的最好的休息，可是死是永恒的宁静，你却对它心惊胆寒。死即睡眠，它不过如此！但在睡眠中可能有梦。他突然铲到了一块石头，弯腰把它拾了起来。那么，在死亡的睡眠中，会有什么样的梦呢？

　　头上嗡嗡的轰鸣声已经变成咆哮，他突然间被笼罩在了阴影中，有什么东西隔开了他与太阳。他从挖掘和沉思中惊醒，抬起头望去，惊呆了，眼花缭乱，天旋地转。他的思维方才还徜徉在那个比真实还要真实的异世界中，还沉浸在死亡与神明的无边虚境。抬起头却看到头顶上“嗡嗡”作响的飞机，像蝗虫一样盘旋飞来，降落在了他周围的杜鹃花丛中。从这些巨大的“蝗虫”的肚子中，走出一群穿着白粘胶法兰绒衬衫的男人和穿着绸质睡衣裤或棉绒短裤、低胸无袖衬衣的女人（天气实在是太闷热了），每架飞机上都走下一对。短短的几分钟时间，已经下来了十几对。他们在灯塔周围站成一圈，睁大眼睛看着，欢快地笑着，“咔嚓咔嚓”地按动照相机快门，像是喂猴子一样向他扔坚果、整盒的性激素口香糖和腺素黄油饼干。每一分钟，都有越来越多的人穿过拱脊山到达这里，络绎不绝的直升飞机像小溪一样流淌而至。这是一场噩梦的开端，从开始的十几个人变成了后来的几十个人，再变成了成百上千人。

　　野蛮人躲到藏身处，摆出困兽的姿态，无助地靠在灯塔里的墙上，看着数不清的面孔，恐惧得说不出话，像是一个失去了意识的人。

　　一盒口香糖精准地砸到他的脸上，迫使他从迷茫懵懂中回过神来，面对眼前的事实。他疼得一抖，带着强烈的愤怒彻底清醒过来。

　　“滚！”他大喊着。

　　猿人说话了！人群中爆发出掌声和笑声。“野蛮人老朋友，来一个，来一个！”在嘈杂的人群中，他听到了一声尖叫：“鞭子，鞭子，甩鞭子！”

　　这话语提醒了野蛮人，他从门后的钉子上解下那根带绳结的鞭子，向那些丑恶的施暴者挥舞着。

　　人群中响起讥讽的喝彩和掌声。

　　他凶神恶煞地走向人群，有个女人害怕地尖叫起来。鞭子不断地挥舞着，首当其冲的几个人开始还犹豫退缩，但随后就站直身，动也不动。压倒性的数量优势使得观光客们勇气倍增，这是野蛮人万万没有料到的，他大吃一惊，收回鞭子，环顾四周。

　　“你们为什么不让我清清静静地生活？”他愤怒的声音中夹杂着悲怆。

　　离野蛮人最近的敌人递过一小包零食：“尝尝这些镁盐大杏仁！你知道，这很美味，”他继续说道，笑容中带有一丝劝说的意味，“镁盐大杏仁有助于你保持青春。”

　　野蛮人不予理会。“你们想要我怎样？”他问，目光从一张狰狞的笑脸转到另一张狰狞的笑脸，“你们到底想要我怎样？”

　　“抽鞭子呀，”上百个声音参差不齐地回答，“表演一下抽鞭子，我们想看！”

　　然后声音变得一致、低沉而有节奏，“我——们——要——看——抽——鞭——子，”他背后的人群也叫喊起来，“我——们——要——看——抽——鞭——子。”

　　其他人立刻响应，鹦鹉学舌般不断重复着那句话，一遍又一遍，音量不断增大，直到第七八次重复的时候，已经完全整齐划一，“我——们——要——看——抽——鞭——子。”

　　如同全民狂欢般，他们沉浸在喧闹的快感中，享受着团结的乐趣，沉迷于亢奋的节奏，仿佛可以持续不断地叫下去，永不停止。大概重复到第二十五次时，声音突然被打断。一架直升飞机穿过拱脊山飞了过来，在人群上方盘旋着，然后在离野蛮人几码远的地方降落，停在人群和灯塔间的空地上。人群的叫喊一时被螺旋桨的呼啸声压下来。在飞机着陆，引擎熄灭的一瞬间，“我们要看抽鞭子”的叫喊声再次响起，同样的节奏，同样的声调。

　　直升飞机的门打开了，一个英俊潇洒的年轻男人走出来，脸色红润得像红宝石，跟在他身后的，是一个穿着绿色棉绒短裤、白色衬衫，头戴骑兵帽的年轻女人。

　　看到那个年轻女人的一瞬间，野蛮人震惊得后退了几步，脸色煞白。

　　年轻的女人站在那里，对着他微笑，笑容中掺杂着不确定、恳求和悲伤的绝望。几秒钟后，她的嘴唇张开，说了些什么，但是她的声音完全淹没在观光客的高声叫喊中。

　　“我——们——要——看——抽——鞭——子！我——们——要——看——抽——鞭——子。”

　　年轻女人双手都放在左侧，她那蜜桃般甜美、洋娃娃般娇俏的脸上，露出一种渴求和悲痛交织的不自然的表情，碧蓝的眼睛似乎变得更大，更清澈。突然，两滴珍珠般的眼泪滑落脸颊。她又说话了，还是听不到。她突然迅速而热切地伸出双臂，向野蛮人走去。

　　“我——们——要——看——抽——鞭——子！我——们——要——看……”

　　观光客们的愿望忽然得到了满足。

　　“婊子！”野蛮人歇斯底里地朝她冲过去，“畜生！”他陷入狂乱，用带着绳结的鞭子向她猛地抽过去。

　　女人吓得泪眼婆娑，转身就跑，跌跌撞撞地摔倒在杜鹃花丛中。“亨利，亨利！”她大声呼救，但是那个面色红润的俊俏伙伴早就躲到了直升飞机后面，以免受到牵连。

　　在一片如愿以偿的喝彩声中，成堆的人群刹那间散开，蜂拥奔向精彩表演的中心。疼痛啊，是一种动人心魄的恐惧！

　　“惩戒淫欲，惩戒淫欲！”野蛮人又一次疯狂地抽打她。

　　人群充满渴望的集结在一起，推推搡搡地乱挤乱拱，就像是猪猡在抢夺饲料。

　　“啊，肉欲！”野蛮人咬着牙，将鞭子挥到自己的肩膀上。“消灭肉欲！消灭肉欲！”

　　对痛苦的恐惧像是迷人的魔法、让人上瘾的毒品。当野蛮人一下又一下地抽打自己反叛堕落的身体时，深深根植于文明人内心的条件设置发挥了作用，人群被一种共同合作的冲动所驱使，被一种集体一致的欲望所控制，他们开始疯狂地模仿野蛮人的姿势，互相扭打攻击，或者殴打那杜鹃花丛中因疼痛而不断翻滚的丰腴身体——那是荒淫邪恶的象征。

　　“消灭肉欲，消灭肉欲，消灭肉欲……”野蛮人不停地大喊。

　　突然，有人开始唱“纵情啊狂欢”。很快，所有人都在副歌部分一起唱起来，还跳起了舞。纵情啊狂欢，旋转，旋转，再旋转，拍击着六八拍的节奏。纵情啊狂欢……

　　静默的午夜，最后一架直升机方才离开。服用了唆麻后，野蛮人昏昏沉沉，长时间的疯狂放纵让他筋疲力尽，他躺在杜鹃花丛中睡去。当他再次睁开双眼，太阳已经升得老高。他躺在地上，像猫头鹰一样对着强烈的阳光困惑地眯起眼睛，然后突然回想起一切。

　　“上帝，上帝！”他用手捂住了双眼。

　　当天晚上，成群的直升飞机轰鸣着穿过拱脊山时，就像是一朵绵延十公里的乌云。前一天晚上的赎罪狂欢会已经登上了各大报纸的头条。

　　“野蛮人！”第一批客人刚下飞机就迫不及待地高喊，“野蛮人先生！”

　　一片寂静。

　　灯塔的门微开，他们推开门，走进昏暗的房间。从房间的另一侧拱门望去，可以看到楼梯通向更高的楼层。就在那个拱门的门框上，垂下了一双脚。

　　“野蛮人先生！”

　　那双脚慢慢地，慢慢地摇晃着，像是两根不慌不忙的圆规的脚，向右边转了过来，然后向北，东北，东，东南，南，西南，停了一会儿，又缓慢地向左边转过去，南，西南，南，东南，东……

第31章 Chapter One(1)


　　a squat grey building of only thirty-four stories. over the main entrance the words， central london hatchery and conditioning centre， and， in a shield， the world state’s motto， community， identity， stability.

　　the enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. cold for all the summer beyond the panes， for all the tropical heat of the room itself， a harsh thin light glared through the windows， hungrily seeking some draped lay figure， some pallid shape of academic goose-flesh， but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porcelain of a laboratory. wintriness responded to wintriness. the overalls of the workers were white， their hands gloved with a pale corpse-coloured rubber. the light was frozen， dead， a ghost. only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance， lying along the polished tubes like butter， streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables.

　　“and this，” said the director opening the door， “is the fertilizing room.”

　　bent over their instruments， three hundred fertilizers were plunged， as the director of hatcheries and conditioning entered the room， in the scarcely breathing silence， the absent-minded， soliloquizing hum or whistle， of absorbed concentration. a troop of newly arrived students， very young， pink and callow， followed nervously， rather abjectly， at the director’s heels. each of them carried a notebook， in which， whenever the great man spoke， he desperately scribbled. straight from the horse’s mouth. it was a rare privilege. the d. h. c. for central london always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments.

　　“just to give you a general idea，” he would explain to them. for of course some sort of general idea they must have， if they were to do their work intelligently–though as little of one， if they were to be good and happy members of society， as possible. for particulars， as every one knows， make for virture and happiness； generalities are intellectually necessary evils. not philosophers but fretsawyers and stamp collectors compose the backbone of society.

　　“to-morrow，” he would add， smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality， “you’ll be settling down to serious work. you won’t have time for generalities. meanwhile…”

　　meanwhile， it was a privilege. straight from the horse’s mouth into the notebook. the boys scribbled like mad.

　　tall and rather thin but upright， the director advanced into the room. he had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth， just covered， when he was not talking， by his full， floridly curved lips. old， young？ thirty？ fifty？ fifty-five？ it was hard to say. and anyhow the question didn’t arise； in this year of stability， a. f. 632， it didn’t occur to you to ask it.

　　“i shall begin at the beginning，” said the d.h.c. and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their notebooks： begin at the beginning. “these，” he waved his hand， “are the incubators.” and opening an insulated door he showed them explained， “at blood heat； whereas the male gametes，” and here he opened another door， “they have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven. full blood heat sterilizes.” rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs.

　　still leaning against the incubators he gave them， while the pencils scurried illegibly across the pages， a brief description of the modern fertilizing process； spoke first， of course， of its surgical introduction– “the operation undergone voluntarily for the good of society， not to mention the fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months’ salary”； continued with some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and actively developing； passed on to a consideration of optimum temperature， salinity， viscosity； referred to the liquor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept； and， leading his charges to the work tables， actually showed them how this liquor was drawn off from the test-tubes； how it was let out drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes； how the eggs which it contained were inspected for abnormalities， counted and transferred to a porous receptacle； how （and he now took them to watch the operation） this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa–at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre， he insisted； and how， after ten minutes， the container was lifted out of the liquor and its contents re-examined； how， if any of the eggs remained unfertilized， it was again immersed， and， if necessary， yet again； how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators； where the alphas and betas remained until definitely bottled； while the gammas， deltas and epsilons were brought out again， after only thirty-six hours， to undergo bokanovsky’s process.

　　“bokanovsky’s process，” repeated the director， and the students underlined the words in their little notebooks.

　　one egg， one embryo， one adult-normality. but a bokanovskified egg will bud， will proliferate， will divide. from eight to ninety-six buds， and every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo， and every embryo into a full-sized adult. making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before. progress.

　　“essentially，” the d.h.c. concluded， “bokanovskification consists of a series of arrests of development. we check the normal growth and， paradoxically enough， the egg responds by budding.”

　　responds by budding. the pencils were busy.

第32章 Chapter One(2)


　　he pointed. on a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was entering a large metal box， another， rack-full was emerging. machinery faintly purred. it took eight minutes for the tubes to go through， he told them. eight minutes of hard x-rays being about as much as an egg can stand. a few died； of the rest， the least susceptible divided into two； most put out four buds； some eight； all were returned to the incubators， where the buds began to develop； then， after two days， were suddenly chilled， chilled and checked. two， four， eight， the buds in their turn budded； and having budded were dosed almost to death with alcohol； consequently burgeoned again and having budded–bud out of bud out of bud–were thereafter–further arrest being generally fatal–left to develop in peace. by which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos– a prodigious improvement， you will agree， on nature. identical twins–but not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days， when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide； actually by dozens， by scores at a time.

　　“scores，” the director repeated and flung out his arms， as though he were distributing largesse. “scores.”

　　but one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay.

　　“my good boy！” the director wheeled sharply round on him. “can’t you see？ can’t you see？” he raised a hand； his expression was solemn. “bokanovsky’s process is one of the major instruments of social stability！”

　　major instruments of social stability.

　　standard men and women； in uniform batches. the whole of a small factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg.

　　“ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines！” the voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. “you really know where you are. for the first time in history.” he quoted the planetary motto. “community， identity， stability.” grand words. “if we could bokanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved.”

　　solved by standard gammas， unvarying deltas， uniform epsilons. millions of identical twins. the principle of mass production at last applied to biology.

　　“but， alas，” the director shook his head， “we can’t bokanovskify indefinitely.”

　　ninety-six seemed to be the limit； seventy-two a good average. from the same ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as many batches of identical twins as possible–that was the best （sadly a second best） that they could do. and even that was difficult.

　　“for in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred eggs to reach maturity. but our business is to stabilize the population at this moment， here and now. dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century–what would be the use of that？”

　　obviously， no use at all. but podsnap’s technique had immensely accelerated the process of ripening. they could make sure of at least a hundred and fifty mature eggs within two years. fertilize and bokanovskify–in other words， multiply by seventy-two–and you get an average of nearly eleven thousand brothers and sisters in a hundred and fifty batches of identical twins， all within two years of the same age.

　　“and in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen thousand adult individuals.”

　　beckoning to a fair-haired， ruddy young man who happened to be passing at the moment. “mr. foster，” he called. the ruddy young man approached. “can you tell us the record for a single ovary， mr. foster？”

　　“sixteen thousand and twelve in this centre，” mr. foster replied without hesitation. he spoke very quickly， had a vivacious blue eye， and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures. “sixteen thousand and twelve； in one hundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals. but of course they’ve done much better，” he rattled on， “in some of the tropical centres. singapore has often produced over sixteen thousand five hundred； and mombasa has actually touched the seventeen thousand mark. but then they have unfair advantages. you should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary！ it’s quite astonishing， when you’re used to working with european material. still，” he added， with a laugh （but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was challenging）， “still， we mean to beat them if we can. i’m working on a wonderful delta-minus ovary at this moment. only just eighteen months old. over twelve thousand seven hundred children already， either decanted or in embryo. and still going strong. we’ll beat them yet.”

　　“that’s the spirit i like！” cried the director， and clapped mr. foster on the shouder. “come along with us， and give these boys the benefit of your expert knowledge.”

　　mr. foster smiled modestly. “with pleasure.” they went.

　　in the bottling room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity. flaps of fresh sow’s peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in little lifts from the organ store in the sub-basement. whizz and then， click！ the lift-hatches hew open； the bottle-liner had only to reach out a hand， take the flap， insert， smooth-down， and before the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the endless band， whizz， click！ another flap of peritoneum had shot up from the depths， ready to be slipped into yet another bottle， the next of that slow interminable procession on the band.

　　next to the liners stood the matriculators. the procession advanced； one by one the eggs were transferred from their test-tubes to the larger containers； deftly the peritoneal lining was slit， the morula dropped into place， the saline solution poured in…and already the bottle had passed， and it was the turn of the labellers. heredity， date of fertilization， membership of bokanovsky group–details were transferred from test-tube to bottle. no longer anonymous， but named， identified， the procession marched slowly on； on through an opening in the wall， slowly on into the social predestination room.

　　“eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index，” said mr. foster with relish， as they entered.

　　“containing all the relevant information，” added the director. “brought up to date every morning.”

　　“and co-ordinated every afternoon.”

　　“on the basis of which they make their calculations.”

　　“so many individuals， of such and such quality，” said mr. foster.

　　“distributed in such and such quantities.”

　　“the optimum decanting rate at any given moment.”

　　“unforeseen wastages promptly made good.”

　　“promptly，” repeated mr. foster. “if you knew the amount of overtime i had to put in after the last japanese earthquake！” he laughed goodhumouredly and shook his head.

　　“the predestinators send in their figures to the fertilizers.”

　　“who give them the embryos they ask for.”

　　“and the bottles come in here to be predestined in detail.”

　　“after which they are sent down to the embryo store.”

　　“where we now proceed ourselves.”

　　and opening a door mr. foster led the way down a staircase into the basement. the temperature was still tropical. they descended into a thickening twilight. two doors and a passage with a double turn insured the cellar against any possible infiltration of the day.

　　“embryos are like photograph film，” said mr. foster waggishly， as he pushed open the second door. “they can only stand red light.” and in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed him was visible and crimson， like the darkness of closed eyes on a summer’s afternoon. the bulging flanks of row on receding row and tier above tier of bottles glinted with innumerable rubies， and among the rubies moved the dim red spectres of men and women with purple eyes and all the symptoms of lupus. the hum and rattle of machinery faintly stirred the air.

　　“give them a few figures， mr. foster，” said the director， who was tired of talking. mr. foster was only too happy to give them a few figures. two hundred and twenty metres long， two hundred wide， ten high. he pointed upwards. like chickens drinking， the students lifted their eyes towards the distant ceiling.

　　three tiers of racks： ground floor level， first gallery， second gallery.

　　the spidery steel-work of gallery above gallery faded away in all directions into the dark. near them three red ghosts were busily unloading demijohns from a moving staircase.

　　the escalator from the social predestination room.

　　each bottle could be placed on one of fifteen racks， each rack， though you couldn’t see it， was a conveyor traveling at the rate of thirty-three and a third centimetres an hour. two hundred and sixty-seven days at eight metres a day. two thousand one hundred and thirty-six metres in all. one circuit of the cellar at ground level， one on the first gallery， half on the second， and on the two hundred and sixty-seventh morning， daylight in the decanting room. independent existence–so called.

　　“but in the interval，” mr. foster concluded， “we’ve managed to do a lot to them. oh， a very great deal.” his laugh was knowing and triumphant.

　　“that’s the spirit i like，” said the director once more. “let’s walk around. you tell them everything， mr. foster.”

　　mr. foster duly told them.

　　told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum. made them taste the rich blood surrogate on which it fed. explained why it had to be stimulated with placentin and thyroxin. told them of the corpus luteum extract. showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero to 2040 it was automatically injected. spoke of those gradually increasing doses of pituitary administered during the final ninety-six metres of their course. described the artificial maternal circulation installed in every bottle at metre 112； showed them the resevoir of blood-surrogate， the centrifugal pump that kept the liquid moving over the placenta and drove it through the synthetic lung and waste product filter. referred to the embryo’s troublesome tendency to an？mia， to the massive doses of hog’s stomach extract and foetal foal’s liver with which， in consequence， it had to be supplied.

　　showed them the simple mechanism by means of which， during the last two metres out of every eight， all the embryos were simultaneously shaken into familiarity with movement. hinted at the gravity of the so-called “trauma of decanting，” and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize， by a suitable training of the bottled embryo， that dangerous shock. told them of the test for sex carried out in the neighborhood of metre 200. explained the system of labelling–a t for the males， a circle for the females and for those who were destined to become freemartins a question mark， black on a white ground.

　　“for of course，” said mr. foster， “in the vast majority of cases， fertility is merely a nuisance. one fertile ovary in twelve hundred–that would really be quite sufficient for our purposes. but we want to have a good choice. and of course one must always have an enormous margin of safety. so we allow as many as thirty per cent of the female embryos to develop normally. the others get a dose of male sex-hormone every twenty-four metres for the rest of the course. result： they’re decanted as freemartins–structurally quite normal， except，” he had to admit， “that they do have the slightest tendency to grow beards， but sterile. guaranteed sterile. which brings us at last，” continued mr. foster， “out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more interesting world of human invention.”

　　he rubbed his hands. for of course， they didn’t content themselves with merely hatching out embryos： any cow could do that.

　　“we also predestine and condition. we decant our babies as socialized human beings， as alphas or epsilons， as future sewage workers or future…” he was going to say “future world controllers，” but correcting himself， said “future directors of hatcheries，” instead.

　　the d.h.c. acknowledged the compliment with a smile.

　　they were passing metre 320 on rack 11. a young beta-minus mechanic was busy with screw-driver and spanner on the blood-surrogate pump of a passing bottle. the hum of the electric motor deepened by fractions of a tone as he turned the nuts. down， down…a final twist， a glance at the revolution counter， and he was done. he moved two paces down the line and began the same process on the next pump.

第34章 Chapter One(4)


　　“reducing the number of revolutions per minute，” mr. foster explained. “the surrogate goes round slower； therefore passes through the lung at longer intervals； therefore gives the embryo less oxygen. nothing like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par.” again he rubbed his hands.

　　“but why do you want to keep the embryo below par？” asked an ingenuous student.

　　“ass！” said the director， breaking a long silence. “hasn’t it occurred to you that an epsilon embryo must have an epsilon environment as well as an epsilon heredity？”

　　it evidently hadn’t occurred to him. he was covered with confusion.

　　“the lower the caste，” said mr. foster， “the shorter the oxygen.” the first organ affected was the brain. after that the skeleton. at seventy per cent of normal oxygen you got dwarfs. at less than seventy eyeless monsters.

　　“who are no use at all，” concluded mr. foster.

　　whereas （his voice became confidential and eager）， if they could discover a technique for shortening the period of maturation what a triumph， what a benefaction to society！

　　“consider the horse.”

　　they considered it.

　　mature at six； the elephant at ten. while at thirteen a man is not yet sexually mature； and is only full-grown at twenty. hence， of course， that fruit of delayed development， the human intelligence.

　　“but in epsilons，” said mr. foster very justly， “we don’t need human intelligence.”

　　didn’t need and didn’t get it. but though the epsilon mind was mature at ten， the epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen. long years of superfluous and wasted immaturity. if the physical development could be speeded up till it was as quick， say， as a cow’s， what an enormous saving to the community！

　　“enormous！” murmured the students. mr. foster’s enthusiasm was infectious.

　　he became rather technical； spoke of the abnormal endocrine co-ordination which made men grow so slowly； postulated a germinal mutation to account for it. could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone？ could the individual epsilon embryo be made a revert， by a suitable technique， to the normality of dogs and cows？ that was the problem. and it was all but solved.

　　pilkington， at mombasa， had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full-grown at six and a half. a scientific triumph. but socially useless. six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even epsilon work. and the process was an all-or-nothing one； either you failed to modify at all， or else you modified the whole way. they were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six. so far without success. mr. foster sighed and shook his head.

　　their wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the neighborhood of metre 170 on rack 9. from this point onwards rack 9 was enclosed and the bottle performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of tunnel， interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide.

　　“heat conditioning，” said mr. foster.

　　hot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels. coolness was wedded to discomfort in the form of hard x-rays. by the time they were decanted the embryos had a horror of cold. they were predestined to emigrate to the tropics， to be miner and acetate silk spinners and steel workers. later on their minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their bodies. “we condition them to thrive on heat，” concluded mr. foster. “our colleagues upstairs will teach them to love it.”

　　“and that，” put in the director sententiously， “that is the secret of happiness and virtue–liking what you’ve got to do. all conditioning aims at that： making people like their unescapable social destiny.”

　　in a gap between two tunnels， a nurse was delicately probing with a long fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle. the students and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in silence.

　　“well， lenina，” said mr. foster， when at last she withdrew the syringe and straightened herself up.

　　the girl turned with a start. one could see that， for all the lupus and the purple eyes， she was uncommonly pretty.

　　“henry！” her smile flashed redly at him–a row of coral teeth.

　　“charming， charming，” murmured the director and， giving her two or three little pats， received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself.

　　“what are you giving them？” asked mr. foster， making his tone very professional.

　　“oh， the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness.”

　　“tropical workers start being inoculated at metre 150，” mr. foster explained to the students. “the embryos still have gills. we immunize the fish against the future man’s diseases.” then， turning back to lenina， “ten to five on the roof this afternoon，” he said， “as usual.”

　　“charming，” said the dhector once more， and， with a final pat， moved away after the others.

　　on rack 10 rows of next generation’s chemical workers were being trained in the toleration of lead， caustic soda， tar， chlorine. the first of a batch of two hundred and fifty embryonic rocket-plane engineers was just passing the eleven hundred metre mark on rack 3. a special mechanism kept their containers in constant rotation. “to improve their sense of balance，” mr. foster explained. “doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid-air is a ticklish job. we slacken off the circulation when they’re right way up， so that they’re half starved， and double the flow of surrogate when they’re upside down. they learn to associate topsy-turvydom with weli-being； in fact， they’re only truly happy when they’re standing on their heads.

　　“and now，” mr. foster went on， “i’d like to show you some very interesting conditioning for alpha plus intellectuals. we have a big batch of them on rack 5. first gallery level，” he called to two boys who had started to go down to the ground floor.

　　“they’re round about metre 900，” he explained. “you can’t really do any useful intellectual conditioning till the foetuses have lost their tails. follow me.”

　　but the director had looked at his watch. “ten to three，” he said. “no time for the intellectual embryos， i’m afraid. we must go up to the nurseries before the children have finished their afternoon sleep.”

　　mr. foster was disappointed. “at least one glance at the decanting room，” he pleaded.

　　“very well then.” the director smiled indulgently. “just one glance.”

第35章 Chapter Two(1)


　　mr. foster was left in the decanting room. the d.h.c. and his students stepped into the nearest lift and were carried up to the fifth floor.

　　infant nurseries. neo-pavlovian conditioning rooms， announced the notice board.

　　the director opened a door. they were in a large bare room， very bright and sunny； for the whole of the southern wall was a single window. half a dozen nurses， trousered and jacketed in the regulation white viscose-linen uniform， their hair aseptically hidden under white caps， were engaged in setting out bowls of roses in a long row across the floor. big bowls， packed tight with blossom. thousands of petals， ripe-blown and silkily smooth， like the cheeks of innumerable little cherubs， but of cherubs， in that bright light， not exclusively pink and aryan， but also luminously chinese， also mexican， also apoplectic with too much blowing of celestial trumpets， also pale as death， pale with the posthumous whiteness of marble.

　　the nurses stiffened to attention as the d.h.c. came in.

　　“set out the books，” he said curtly.

　　in silence the nurses obeyed his command. between the rose bowls the books were duly set out–a row of nursery quartos opened invitingly each at some gaily coloured image of beast or fish or bird.

　　“now bring in the children.”

　　they hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two， each pushing a kind of tall dumb-waiter laden， on all its four wire-netted shelves， with eight-month-old babies， all exactly alike （a bokanovsky group， it was evident） and all （since their caste was delta） dressed in khaki.

　　“put them down on the floor.”

　　the infants were unloaded.

　　“now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books.”

　　turned， the babies at once fell silent， then began to crawl towards those clusters of sleek colours， those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white pages. as they approached， the sun came out of a momentary eclipse behind a cloud. the roses flamed up as though with a sudden passion from within； a new and profound sigruficance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books. from the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement， gurgles and twitterings of pleasure.

　　the director rubbed his hands. “excellent！” he said. “it might almost have been done on purpose.”

　　the swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. small hands reached out uncertainly， touched， grasped， unpetaling the transfigured roses， crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. the director waited until all were happily busy. then， “watch carefully，” he said. and， lifting his hand， he gave the signal.

　　the head nurse， who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the room， pressed down a little lever.

　　there was a violent explosion. shriller and ever shriller， a siren shrieked. alarm bells maddeningly sounded.

　　the children started， screamed； their faces were distorted with terror.

　　“and now，” the director shouted （for the noise was deafening）， “now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock.”

　　he waved his hand again， and the head nurse pressed a second lever. the screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. there was something desperate， almost insane， about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now gave utterance. their little bodies twitched and stiffened； their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires.

　　“we can electrify that whole strip of floor，” bawled the director in explanation. “but that’s enough，” he signalled to the nurse.

　　the explosions ceased， the bells stopped ringing， the shriek of the siren died down from tone to tone into silence. the stiffly twitching bodies relaxed， and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror.

　　“offer them the flowers and the books again.”

　　the nurses obeyed； but at the approach of the roses， at the mere sight of those gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black sheep， the infants shrank away in horror， the volume of their howling suddenly increased.

　　“observe，” said the director triumphantly， “observe.”

　　books and loud noises， fiowers and electric shocks–already in the infant mind these couples were compromisingly linked； and after two hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. what man has joined， nature is powerless to put asunder.

　　“they’ll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an ‘instinctive’ hatred of books and flowers. reflexes unalterably conditioned. they’ll be safe from books and botany all their lives.” the director turned to his nurses. “take them away again.”

　　still yelling， the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and wheeled out， leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome silence.

　　one of the students held up his hand； and though he could see quite well why you couldn’t have lower-cast people wasting the community’s time over books， and that there was always the risk of their reading something which might undesirably decondition one of their reflexes， yet…well， he couldn’t understand about the flowers. why go to the trouble of making it psychologically impossible for deltas to like flowers？

　　patiently the d.h.c. explained. if the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose， that was on grounds of high economic policy. not so very long ago （a century or thereabouts）， gammas， deltas， even epsilons， had been conditioned to like flowers–flowers in particular and wild nature in general. the idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity， and so compel them to consume transport.

　　“and didn’t they consume transport？” asked the student.

　　“quite a lot，” the d.h.c. replied. “but nothing else.”

　　primroses and landscapes， he pointed out， have one grave defect： they are gratuitous. a love of nature keeps no factories busy. it was decided to abolish the love of nature， at any rate among the lower classes； to abolish the love of nature， but not the tendency to consume transport. for of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country， even though they hated it. the problem was to find an economically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affection for primroses and landscapes. it was duly found.

第36章 Chapter Two(2)


　　“we condition the masses to hate the country，” concluded the director. “but simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. at the same time， we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. so that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport. hence those electric shocks.”

　　“i see，” said the student， and was silent， lost in admiration.

　　there was a silence； then， clearing his throat， “once upon a time，” the director began， “while our ford was still on earth， there was a little boy called reuben rabinovitch. reuben was the child of polish-speaking parents.”

　　the director interrupted himself. “you know what polish is， i suppose？”

　　“a dead language.”

　　“like french and german，” added another student， officiously showing off his learning.

　　“and ‘parent’？” questioned the d.h.c.

　　there was an uneasy silence. several of the boys blushed. they had not yet learned to draw the significant but often very fine distinction between smut and pure science. one， at last， had the courage to raise a hand.

　　“human beings used to be…” he hesitated； the blood rushed to his cheeks. “well， they used to be viviparous.”

　　“quite right.” the director nodded approvingly.

　　“and when the babies were decanted…”

　　“‘born，’” came the correction.

　　“well， then they were the parents–i mean， not the babies， of course； the other ones.” the poor boy was overwhelmed with confusion.

　　“in brief，” the director summed up， “the parents were the father and the mother.” the smut that was really science fell with a crash into the boys’ eye-avoiding silence. “mother，” he repeated loudly rubbing in the science； and， leaning back in his chair， “these，” he said gravely， “are unpleasant facts； i know it. but then most historical facts are unpleasant.”

　　he returned to little reuben–to little reuben， in whose room， one evening， by an oversight， his father and mother （crash， crash！） happened to leave the radio turned on.

　　（“for you must remember that in those days of gross viviparous reproduction， children were always brought up by their parents and not in state conditioning centres.”）

　　while the child was asleep， a broadcast programme from london suddenly started to come through； and the next morning， to the astonishment of his crash and crash （the more daring of the boys ventured to grin at one another）， little reuben woke up repeating word for word a long lecture by that curious old writer （“one of the very few whose works have been permitted to come down to us”）， george bernard shaw， who was speaking， according to a well-authenticated tradition， about his own genius. to little reuben’s wink and snigger， this lecture was， of course， perfectly incomprehensible and， imagining that their child had suddenly gone mad， they sent for a doctor. he， fortunately， understood english， recognized the discourse as that which shaw had broadcasted the previous evening， realized the significance of what had happened， and sent a letter to the medical press about it.

　　“the principle of sleep-teaching， or hypnop？dia， had been discovered.” the d.h.c. made an impressive pause.

　　the principle had been discovered； but many， many years were to elapse before that principle was usefully applied.

　　“the case of little reuben occurred only twenty-three years after our ford’s first t-model was put on the market.” （here the director made a sign of the t on his stomach and all the students reverently followed suit.） “and yet…”

　　furiously the students scribbled. “hypnop？dia， first used officially in a.f. 214. why not before？ two reasons. （a）…”

　　“these early experimenters，” the d.h.c. was saying， “were on the wrong track. they thought that hypnop？dia could be made an instrument of intellectual education…”

　　（a small boy asleep on his right side， the right arm stuck out， the right hand hanging limp over the edge of the bed. through a round grating in the side of a box a voice speaks softly.

　　“the nile is the longest river in africa and the second in length of all the rivers of the globe. although falling short of the length of the mississippi-missouri， the nile is at the head of all rivers as regards the length of its basin， which extends through 35 degrees of latitude…”

　　at breakfast the next morning， “tommy，” some one says， “do you know which is the longest river in africa？” a shaking of the head. “but don’t you remember something that begins： the nile is the…”

　　“the - nile - is - the - longest - river - in - africa - and - the - second - in - length -of - all - the - rivers - of - the - globe…” the words come rushing out. “although -falling - short - of…”

　　“well now， which is the longest river in africa？”

　　the eyes are blank. “i don’t know.”

　　“but the nile， tommy.”

　　“the - nile - is - the - longest - river - in - africa - and - second…”

　　“then which river is the longest， tommy？”

第37章 Chapter Two(3)


　　tommy burst into tears. “i don’t know，” he howls.）

　　that howl， the director made it plain， discouraged the earliest invesfigators. the experiments were abandoned. no further attempt was made to teach children the length of the nile in their sleep. quite rightly. you can’t learn a science unless you know what it’s all about.

　　“whereas， if they’d only started on moral education，” said the director， leading the way towards the door. the students followed him， desperately scribbling as they walked and all the way up in the lift. “moral education， which ought never， in any circumstances， to be rational.”

　　“silence， silence，” whispered a loud speaker as they stepped out at the fourteenth floor， and “silence， silence，” the trumpet mouths indefatigably repeated at intervals down every corridor. the students and even the director himself rose automatically to the tips of their toes. they were alphas， of course， but even alphas have been well conditioned. “silence， silence.” all the air of the fourteenth floor was sibilant with the categorical imperative.

　　fifty yards of tiptoeing brought them to a door which the director cautiously opened. they stepped over the threshold into the twilight of a shuttered dormitory. eighty cots stood in a row against the wall. there was a sound of light regular breathing and a continuous murmur， as of very faint voices remotely whispering.

　　a nurse rose as they entered and came to attention before the director.

　　“what’s the lesson this afternoon？” he asked.

　　“we had elementary sex for the first forty minutes，” she answered. “but now it’s switched over to elementary class consciousness.”

　　the director walked slowly down the long line of cots. rosy and relaxed with sleep， eighty little boys and girls lay seftly hreathing. there was a whisper under every pillow. the d.h.c. halted and， bending over one of the little beds， listened attentively.

　　“elementary class consciousness， did you say？ let’s have it repeated a little louder by the trumpet.”

　　at the end of the room a loud speaker projected from the wall. the director walked up to it and pressed a switch.

　　“…all wear green，” said a soft but very distinct voice， beginning in the middle of a sentence， “and delta children wear khaki. oh no， i don’t want to play with delta children. and epsilons are still worse. they’re too stupid to be able to read or write. besides they wear black， which is such a beastly colour. i’m so glad i’m a beta.”

　　there was a pause； then the voice began again.

　　“alpha children wear grey they work much harder than we do， because they’re so frightfully clever. i’m really awfuly glad i’m a beta， because i don’t work so hard. and then we are much better than the gammas and deltas. gammas are stupid. they all wear green， and delta children wear khaki. oh no， i don’t want to play with delta children. and epsilons are still worse. they’re too stupid to be able…”

　　the director pushed back the switch. the voice was silent. only its thin ghost continued to mutter from beneath the eighty pillows.

　　“they’ll have that repeated forty or fifty times more before they wake； then again on thursday， and again on saturday. a hundred and twenty times three times a week for thirty months. after which they go on to a more advanced lesson.”

　　roses and electric shocks， the khaki of deltas and a whiff of asaf？tida–wedded indissolubly before the child can speak. but wordless conditioning is crude and wholesale； cannot bring home the finer distinctions， cannot inculcate the more complex courses of behaviour. for that there must be words， but words without reason. in brief， hypnop？dia.

　　“the greatest moralizing and socializing force of all time.”

　　the students took it down in their little books. straight from the horse’s mouth.

　　once more the director touched the switch.

　　“…so frightfully clever，” the soft， insinuating， indefatigable voice was saying， “i’m really awfully glad i’m a beta， because…”

　　not so much like drops of water， though water， it is true， can wear holes in the hardest granite； rather， drops of liquid sealing-wax， drops that adhere， incrust， incorporate themselves with what they fall on， till finally the rock is all one scarlet blob.

　　“till at last the child’s mind is these suggestions， and the sum of the suggestions is the child’s mind. and not the child’s mind only. the adult’s mind too–all his life long. the mind that judges and desires and decides–made up of these suggestions. but all these suggestions are our suggestions！” the director almost shouted in his triumph. “suggestions from the state.” he banged the nearest table. “it therefore follows…”

　　a noise made him turn round.

　　“oh， ford！” he said in another tone， “i’ve gone and woken the children.”

第38章 Chapter Three(1)


　　outside， in the garden， it was playtime. naked in the warm june sunshine， six or seven hundred little boys and girls were running with shrill yells over the lawns， or playing ball games， or squatting silently in twos and threes among the flowering shrubs. the roses were in bloom， two nightingales soliloquized in the boskage， a cuckoo was just going out of tune among the lime trees. the air was drowsy with the murmur of bees and helicopters.

　　the director and his students stood for a short time watching a game of centrifugal bumble-puppy. twenty children were grouped in a circle round a chrome steel tower. a ball thrown up so as to land on the platform at the top of the tower rolled down into the interior， fell on a rapidly revolving disk， was hurled through one or other of the numerous apertures pierced in the cylindrical casing， and had to be caught.

　　“strange，” mused the director， as they turned away， “strange to think that even in our ford’s day most games were played without more apparatus than a ball or two and a few sticks and perhaps a bit of netting. imagine the folly of allowing people to play elaborate games which do nothing whatever to increase consumption. it’s madness. nowadays the controllers won’t approve of any new game unless it can be shown that it requires at least as much apparatus as the most complicated of existing games.” he interrupted himself.

　　“that’s a charming little group，” he said， pointing.

　　in a little grassy bay between tall clumps of mediterranean heather， two children， a little boy of about seven and a little girl who might have been a year older， were playing， very gravely and with all the focussed attention of scientists intent on a labour of discovery， a rudimentary sexual game.

　　“charming， charming！” the d.h.c. repeated sentimentally.

　　“charming，” the boys politely agreed. but their smile was rather patronizing. they had put aside similar childish amusements too recently to be able to watch them now without a touch of contempt. charming？ but it was just a pair of kids fooling about； that was all. just kids.

　　“i always think，” the director was continuing in the same rather maudlin tone， when he was interrupted by a loud boo-hooing.

　　from a neighbouring shrubbery emerged a nurse， leading by the hand a small boy， who howled as he went. an anxious-looking little girl trotted at her heels.

　　“what’s the matter？” asked the director.

　　the nurse shrugged her shoulders. “nothing much，” she answered. “it’s just that this little boy seems rather reluctant to join in the ordinary erotic play. i’d noticed it once or twice before. and now again to-day. he started yelling just now…”

　　“honestly，” put in the anxious-looking little girl， “i didn’t mean to hurt him or anything. honestly.”

　　“of course you didn’t， dear，” said the nurse reassuringly. “and so，” she went on， turning back to the director， “i’m taking him in to see the assistant superintendent of psychology. just to see if anything’s at all abnormal.”

　　“ouite right，” said the director. “take him in. you stay here， little girl，” he added， as the nurse moved away with her still howling charge. “what’s your name？”

　　“polly trotsky.”

　　“and a very good name too，” said the director. “run away now and see if you can find some other little boy to play with.”

　　the child scampered off into the bushes and was lost to sight.

　　“exquisite little creature！” said the director， looking after her. then， turning to his students， “what i’m going to tell you now，” he said， “may sound incredible. but then， when you’re not accustomed to history， most facts about the past do sound incredible.”

　　he let out the amazing truth. for a very long period before the time of our ford， and even for some generations afterwards， erotic play between children had been regarded as abnormal （there was a roar of laughter）； and not only abnormal， actually immoral （no！）： and had therefore been rigorously suppressed.

　　a look of astonished incredulity appeared on the faces of his listeners. poor little kids not allowed to amuse themselves？ they could not believe it.

　　“even adolescents，” the d.h.c. was saying， “even adolescents like yourselves…”

　　“not possible！”

　　“barring a little surreptitious auto-erotism and homosexuality–absolutely nothing.”

　　“nothing？”

　　“in most cases， till they were over twenty years old.”

　　“twenty years old？” echoed the students in a chorus of loud disbelief.

　　“twenty，” the director repeated. “i told you that you’d find it incredible.”

　　“but what happened？” they asked. “what were the results？”

　　“the results were terrible.” a deep resonant voice broke startlingly into the dialogue. they looked around. on the fringe of the little group stood a stranger–a man of middle height， black-haired， with a hooked nose， full red lips， eyes very piercing and dark.

　　“terrible，” he repeated. the d.h.c. had at that moment sat down on one of the steel and rubber benches conveniently scattered through the gardens； but at the sight of the stranger， he sprang to his feet and darted forward， his hand outstretched， smiling with all his teeth， effusive.

　　“controller！ what an unexpected pleasure！ boys， what are you thinking of？ this is the controller； this is his fordship， mustapha mond.”

　　in the four thousand rooms of the centre the four thousand electric clocks simultaneously struck four. discarnate voices called from the trumpet mouths.

　　“main day-shift off duty. second day-shift take over. main day-shift off…”

　　in the lift， on their way up to the changing rooms， henry foster and the assistant director of predestination rather pointedly turned their backs on bernard marx from the psychology bureau： averted themselves from that unsavoury reputation.

　　the faint hum and rattle of machinery still stirred the crimson air in the embryo store. shifts might come and go， one lupus-coloured face give place to another； majestically and for ever the conveyors crept forward with their load of future men and women.

　　lenina crowne walked briskly towards the door.

　　his fordship mustapha mond！ the eyes of the saluting students almost popped out of their heads. mustapha mond！ the resident controller for western europe！ one of the ten world controllers. one of the ten…and he sat down on the bench with the d.h.c.， he was going to stay， to stay， yes， and actually talk to them…straight from the horse’s mouth. straight from the mouth of ford himself.

第39章 Chapter Three(2)


　　two shrimp-brown children emerged from a neighbouring shrubbery， stared at them for a moment with large， astonished eyes， then returned to their amusements among the leaves.

　　“you all remember，” said the controller， in his strong deep voice， “you all remember， i suppose， that beautiful and inspired saying of our ford’s： history is bunk. history，” he repeated slowly， “is bunk.”

　　he waved his hand； and it was as though， with an invisible feather wisk， he had brushed away a little dust， and the dust was harappa， was ur of the chaldees； some spider-webs， and they were thebes and babylon and cnossos and mycenae. whisk. whisk–and where was odysseus， where was job， where were jupiter and gotama and jesus？ whisk–and those specks of antique dirt called athens and rome， jerusalem and the middle kingdom–all were gone. whisk–the place where italy had been was empty. whisk， the cathedrals； whisk， whisk， king lear and the thoughts of pascal. whisk， passion； whisk， requiem； whisk， symphony； whisk…

　　“going to the feelies this evening， henry？” enquired the assistant predestinator. “i hear the new one at the alhambra is first-rate. there’s a love scene on a bearskin rug； they say it’s marvellous. every hair of the bear reproduced. the most amazing tactual effects.”

　　“that’s why you’re taught no history，” the controller was saying. “but now the time has come…”

　　the d.h.c. looked at him nervously. there were those strange rumours of old forbidden books hidden in a safe in the controller’s study. bibles， poetry–ford knew what.

　　mustapha mond intercepted his anxious glance and the corners of his red lips twitched ironically.

　　“it’s all right， director，” he said in a tone of faint derision， “i won’t corrupt them.”

　　the d.h.c. was overwhelmed with confusion.

　　those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising. the smile on bernard marx’s face was contemptuous. every hair on the bear indeed！

　　“i shall make a point of going，” said henry foster.

　　mustapha mond leaned forward， shook a finger at them. “just try to realize it，” he said， and his voice sent a strange thrill quivering along their diaphragms. “try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous mother.”

　　that smutty word again. but none of them dreamed， this time， of smiling.

　　“try to imagine what ‘living with one’s family’ meant.”

　　they tried； but obviously without the smallest success.

　　“and do you know what a ‘home’ was？”

　　they shook their heads.

　　from her dim crimson cellar lenina crowne shot up seventeen stories， turned to the right as she stepped out of the lift， walked down a long corridor and， opening the door marked girls’ dressing-room， plunged into a deafening chaos of arms and bosoms and underclothing. torrents of hot water were splashing into or gurgling out of a hundred baths. rumbling and hissing， eighty vibro-vacuum massage machines were simultaneously kneading and sucking the firm and sunburnt flesh of eighty superb female specimens. every one was talking at the top of her voice. a synthetic music machine was warbling out a super-cornet solo.

　　“hullo， fanny，” said lenina to the young woman who had the pegs and locker next to hers.

　　fanny worked in the bottling room， and her surname was also crowne. but as the two thousand million inhabitants of the plant had only ten thousand names between them， the coincidence was not particularly surprising.

　　lenina pulled at her zippers-downwards on the jacket， downwards with a double-handed gesture at the two that held trousers， downwards again to loosen her undergarment. still wearing her shoes and stockings， she walked off towards the bathrooms.

　　home， home–a few small rooms， stiflingly over-inhabited by a man， by a periodically teeming woman， by a rabble of boys and girls of all ages. no air， no space； an understerilized prison； darkness， disease， and smells.

　　（the controller’s evocation was so vivid that one of the boys， more sensitive than the rest， turned pale at the mere description and was on the point of being sick.）

　　lenina got out of the bath， toweled herself dry， took hold of a long flexible tube plugged into the wall， presented the nozzle to her breast， as though she meant to commit suicide， pressed down the trigger. a blast of warmed air dusted her with the finest talcum powder. eight different scents and eau-de-cologne were laid on in little taps over the wash-basin. she turned on the third from the left， dabbed herself with chypre and， carrying her shoes and stockings in her hand， went out to see if one of the vibro-vacuum machines were free.

　　and home was as squalid psychically as physically. psychically， it was a rabbit hole， a midden， hot with the frictions of tightly packed life， reeking with emotion. what suffocating intimacies， what dangerous， insane， obscene relationships between the members of the family group！ maniacally， the mother brooded over her children （her children）…brooded over them like a cat over its kittens； but a cat that could talk， a cat that could say， “my baby， my baby，” over and over again. “my baby， and oh， oh， at my breast， the little hands， the hunger， and that unspeakable agonizing pleasure！ till at last my baby sleeps， my baby sleeps with a bubble of white milk at the corner of his mouth. my little baby sleeps…”

　　“yes，” said mustapha mond， nodding his head， “you may well shudder.”

　　“who are you going out with to-night？” lenina asked， returning from the vibro-vac like a pearl illuminated from within， pinkly glowing.

　　“nobody.”

　　lenina raised her eyebrows in astonishment.

　　“i’ve been feeling rather out of sorts lately，” fanny explained. “dr. wells advised me to have a pregnancy substitute.”

　　“but， my dear， you’re only nineteen. the first pregnancy substitute isn’t compulsory till twenty-one.”

　　“i know， dear. but some people are better if they begin earlier. dr. wells told me that brunettes with wide pelvises， like me， ought to have their first pregnancy substitute at seventeen. so i’m really two years late， not two years early.” she opened the door of her locker and pointed to the row of boxes and labelled phials on the upper shelf.

第40章 Chapter Three(3)


　　“syrup of corpus luteum，” lenina read the names aloud. “ovarin， guaranteed fresh： not to be used after august 1st， a.f. 632. mammary gland extract： to be taken three times daily， before meals， with a little water. placentin： 5cc to be injected intravenally every third day…ugh！” lenina shuddered. “how i loathe intravenals， don’t you？”

　　“yes. but when they do one good…” fanny was a particularly sensible girl.

　　our ford–or our freud， as， for some inscrutable reason， he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters–our freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life. the world was full of fathers–was therefore full of misery； full of mothers–therefore of every kind of perversion from sadism to chastity； full of brothers， sisters， uncles， aunts–full of madness and suicide.

　　“and yet， among the savages of samoa， in certain islands off the coast of new guinea…”

　　the tropical sunshine lay like warm honey on the naked bodies of children tumbling promiscuously among the hibiscus blossoms. home was in any one of twenty palm-thatched houses. in the trobriands conception was the work of ancestral ghosts； nobody had ever heard of a father.

　　“extremes，” said the controller， “meet. for the good reason that they were made to meet.”

　　“dr. wells says that a three months’ pregnancy substitute now will make all the difference to my health for the next three or four years.”

　　“well， i hope he’s right，” said lenina. “but， fanny， do you really mean to say that for the next three moaths you’re not supposed to…”

　　“oh no， dear. only for a week or two， that’s all. i shall spend the evening at the club playing musical bridge. i suppose you’re going out？”

　　lenina nodded.

　　“who with？”

　　“henry foster.”

　　“again？” fanny’s kind， rather moon-like face took on an incongruous expression of pained and disapproving astonishment. “do you mean to tell me you’re still going out with henry foster？”

　　mothers and fathers， brothers and sisters. but there were also husbands， wives， lovers. there were also monogamy and romance.

　　“though you probably don’t know what those are，” said mustapha mond.

　　they shook their heads.

　　family， monogamy， romance. everywhere exclusiveness， a narrow channelling of impulse and energy.

　　“but every one belongs to every one else，” he concluded， citing the hypnop？dic proverb.

　　the students nodded， emphatically agreeing with a statement which upwards of sixty-two thousand repetitions in the dark had made them accept， not merely as true， but as axiomatic， self-evident， utterly indisputable.

　　“but after all，” lenina was protesting， “it’s only about four months now since i’ve been having henry.”

　　“only four months！ i like that. and what’s more，” fanny went on， pointing an accusing finger， “there’s been nobody else except henry all that time. has there？”

　　lenina blushed scarlet； but her eyes， the tone of her voice remained defiant. “no， there hasn’t been any one else，” she answered almost trucuently. “and i jolly well don’t see why there should have been.”

　　“oh， she jolly well doesn’t see why there should have been，” fanny repeated， as though to an invisible listener behind lenina’s left shoulder. then， with a sudden change of tone， “but seriously，” she said， “i really do think you ought to be careful. it’s such horribly bad form to go on and on like this with one man. at forty， or thirty-five， it wouldrl’t be so bad. but at your age， lenina！ no， it really won’t do. and you know how strongly the d.h.c. objects to anything intense or long-drawn. four months of henry foster， without having another man–why， he’d be furious if he knew…”

　　“think of water under pressure in a pipe.” they thought of it. “i pierce it once，” said the controller. “what a jet！”

　　he pierced it twenty times. there were twenty piddling little fountains.

　　“my baby. my baby…！”

　　“mother！” the madness is infectious.

　　“my love， my one and only， precious， precious…”

　　mother， monogamy， romance. high spurts the fountain； fierce and foamy the wild jet. the urge has but a single outlet. my love， my baby. no wonder these poor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miserable. their world didn’t allow them to take things easily， didn’t allow them to be sane， virtuous， happy. what with mothers and lovers， what with the prohibitions they were not conditioned to obey， what with the temptations and the lonely remorses， what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain， what with the uncertainties and the poverty–they were forced to feel strongly. and feeling strongly （and strongly， what was more， in solitude， in hopelessly individual isolation）， how could they be stable？

　　“of course there’s no need to give him up. have somebody else from time to time， that’s all. he has other girls， doesn’t he？”

　　lenina admitted it.

　　“of course he does. trust henry foster to be the perfect gentleman–always correct. and then there’s the director to think of. you know what a stickler…”

　　nodding， “he patted me on the behind this afternoon，” said lenina.

　　“there， you see！” fanny was triumphant. “that shows what he stands for. the strictest conventionality.”

　　“stability，” said the controller， “stability. no civilization without social stability. no social stability without individual stability.” his voice was a trumpet. listening they felt larger， warmer.

　　the machine turns， turns and must keep on turning–for ever. it is death if it stands still. a thousand millions scrabbled the crust of the earth. the wheels began to turn. in a hundred and fifty years there were two thousand millions. stop all the wheels. in a hundred and fifty weeks there are once more only a thousand millions； a thousand thousand thousand men and women have starved to death.

　　wheels must turn steadily， but cannot turn untended. there must be men to tend them， men as steady as the wheels upon their axles， sane men， obedient men， stable in contentment.

　　crying： my baby， my mother， my only， only love groaning： my sin， my terrible god； screaming with pain，muttering with fever， bemoaning old age and poverty–how can they tend the wheels？ and if they cannot tend the wheels…the corpses of a thousand thousand thousand men and women would be hard to bury or burn.

　　“and after all，” fanny’s tone was coaxing， “it’s not as though there were anything painful or disagreeable about having one or two men besides henry. and seeing that you ought to be a little more promiscuous…”

第41章 Chapter Three(4)


　　“stability，” insisted the controller， “stability. the primal and the ultimate need. stability. hence all this.”

　　with a wave of his hand he indicated the gardens， the huge building of the conditioning centre， the naked children furtive in the undergrowth or running across the lawns.

　　lenina shook her head. “somehow，” she mused， “i hadn’t been feeling very keen on promiscuity lately. there are times when one doesn’t. haven’t you found that too， fanny？”

　　fanny nodded her sympathy and understanding. “but one’s got to make the effort，” she said， sententiously， “one’s got to play the game. after all， every one belongs to every one else.”

　　“yes， every one belongs to every one else，” lenina repeated slowly and， sighing， was silent for a moment； then， taking fanny’s hand， gave it a little squeeze. “you’re quite right， fanny. as usual. i’ll make the effort.”

　　impulse arrested spills over， and the flood is feeling， the flood is passion， the flood is even madness： it depends on the force of the current， the height and strength of the barrier. the unchecked stream flows smoothly down its appointed channels into a calm well-being. the embryo is hungry； day in， day out， the blood-surrogate pump unceasingly turns its eight hundred revolutions a minute. the decanted infant howls； at once a nurse appears with a bottle of external secretion. feeling lurks in that interval of time between desire and its consummation. shorten that interval， break down all those old unnecessary barriers.

　　“fortunate boys！” said the controller. “no pains have been spared to make your lives emotionally easy–to preserve you， so far as that is possible， from having emotions at all.”

　　“ford’s in his flivver，” murmured the d.h.c. “all’s well with the world.”

　　“lenina crowne？” said henry foster， echoing the assistant predestinator’s question as he zipped up his trousers. “oh， she’s a splendid girl. wonderfully pneumatic. i’m surprised you haven’t had her.”

　　“i can’t think how it is i haven’t，” said the assistant predestinator. “i certainly will. at the first opportunity.”

　　from his place on the opposite side of the changing-room aisle， bernard marx overheard what they were saying and turned pale.

　　“and to tell the truth，” said lenina， “i’m beginning to get just a tiny bit bored with nothing but henry every day.” she pulled on her left stocking. “do you know bernard marx？” she asked in a tone whose excessive casualness was evidently forced.

　　fanny looked startled. “you don’t mean to say…？”

　　“why not？ bernard’s an alpha plus. besides， he asked me to go to one of the savage reservations with him. i’ve always wanted to see a savage reservation.”

　　“but his reputation？”

　　“what do i care about his reputation？”

　　“they say he doesn’t like obstacle golf.”

　　“they say， they say，” mocked lenina.

　　“and then he spends most of his time by himself–alone.” there was horror in fanny’s voice.

　　“well， he won’t be alone when he’s with me. and anyhow， why are people so beastly to him？ i think he’s rather sweet.” she smiled to herself； how absurdly shy he had been！ frightened almost–as though she were a world controuer and he a gamma-minus machine minder.

　　“consider your own lives，” said mustapha mond. “has any of you ever encountered an insurmountable obstacle？”

　　the question was answered by a negative silence. “has any of you been compelled to live through a long time-interval between the consciousness of a desire and its fufilment？”

　　“well，” began one of the boys， and hesitated.

　　“speak up，” said the d.h.c. “don’t keep his fordship waiting.”

　　“i once had to wait nearly four weeks before a girl i wanted woud let me have her.”

　　“and you felt a strong emotion in consequence？”

　　“horrible！”

　　“horrible； precisely，” said the controller. “our ancestors were so stupid and short-sighted that when the first reformers came along and offered to deliver them from those horrible emotions， they woudn’t have anything to do with them.”

　　“talking about her as though she were a bit of meat.” bernard ground his teeth. “have her here， have her there.” like mutton. degrading her to so much mutton. she said she’d think it over， she said she’d give me an answer this week. oh， ford， ford， ford.” he would have liked to go up to them and hit them in the face–hard， again and again.

　　“yes， i really do advise you to try her，” henry foster was saying.

　　“take ectogenesis. pfitzner and kawaguchi had got the whole technique worked out. but would the governments look at it？ no. there was something called christianity. women were forced to go on being viviparous.”

　　“he’s so ugly！” said fanny.

　　“but i rather like his looks.”

　　“and then so small.” fanny made a grimace； smallness was so horribly and typically low-caste.

　　“i think that’s rather sweet，” said lenina. “one feels one would like to pet him. you know. like a cat.”

　　fanny was shocked. “they say somebody made a mistake when he was still in the bottle–thought he was a gamma and put alcohol into his blood-surrogate. that’s why he’s so stunted.”

　　“what nonsense！” lenina was indignant.

　　“sleep teaching was actually prohibited in england. there was something called liberalism. parliament， if you know what that was， passed a law against it. the records survive. speeches about liberty of the subject. liberty to be inefficient and miserable. freedom to be a round peg in a square hole.”

　　“but， my dear chap， you’re welcome， i assure you. you’re welcome.” henry foster patted the assistant predestinator on the shoulder. “every one belongs to every one else， after all.”

　　one hundred repetitions three nights a week for four years， thought bernard marx， who was a specialist on hypnop？dia. sixty-two thousand four hundred repetitions make one truth. idiots！

　　“or the caste system. constantly proposed， constantly rejected. there was something called democracy. as though men were more than physico-chemically equal.”

　　“well， all i can say is that i’m going to accept his invitation.”

　　bernard hated them， hated them. but they were two， they were large， they were strong.

　　“the nine years’ war began in a.f. 141.”

　　“not even if it were true about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate.”

　　“phosgene， chloropicrin， ethyl iodoacetate， diphenylcyanarsine， trichlormethyl， chloroformate， dichlorethyl sulphide. not to mention hydrocyanic acid.”

　　“which i simply don’t believe，” lenina concluded.

第42章 Chapter Three(5)


　　“the noise of fourteen thousand aeroplanes advancing in open order. but in the kurfurstendamm and the eighth arrondissement， the explosion of the anthrax bombs is hardly louder than the popping of a paper bag.”

　　“because i do want to see a savage reservation.”

　　ch3c6h2（no2）3+ hg（cno）2=well， what？ an enormous hole in the ground， a pile of masonry， some bits of flesh and mucus， a foot， with the boot still on it， flying through the air and landing， flop， in the middle of the geraniums–the scarlet ones； such a splendid show that summer！

　　“you’re hopeless， lenina， i give you up.”

　　“the russian technique for infecting water supplies was particularly ingenious.”

　　back turned to back， fanny and lenina continued their changing in silence.

　　“the nine years’ war， the great economic collapse. there was a choice between world control and destruction. between stability and…”

　　“fanny crowne’s a nice girl too，” said the assistant predestmator. in the nurseries， the elementary class consciousness lesson was over， the voices were adapting future demand to future industrial supply. “i do love flying，” they whispered， “i do love flying， i do love having new clothes， i do love…”

　　“liberalism， of course， was dead of anthrax， but all the same you couldn’t do things by force.”

　　“not nearly so pneumatic as lenina. oh， not nearly.”

　　“but old clothes are beastly，” continued the untiring whisper. “we always throw away old clothes. ending is better than mending， ending is better thast mending， ending is better…”

　　“government’s an affair of sitting， not hitting. you rule with the brains and the buttocks， never with the fists. for example， there was the conscription of consumption.”

　　“there， i’m ready，” said lenina， but fanny remained speechless and averted. “let’s make peace， fanny darling.”

　　“every man， woman and child compelled to consume so much a year. in the interests of industry. the sole result…”

　　“ending is better than mending. the more stitches， the less riches； the more stitches…”

　　“one of these days，” said fanny， with dismal emphasis， “you’ll get into trouble.”

　　“conscientious objection on an enormous scale. anything not to consume. back to nature.”

　　“i do love flying. i do love flying.”

　　“back to culture. yes， actually to culture. you can’t consume much if you sit still and read books.”

　　“do i look all right？” lenina asked. her jacket was made of bottle green acetate cloth with green viscose fur； at the cuffs and collar.

　　“eight hundred simple lifers were mowed down by machine guns at golders green.”

　　“ending is better than mending， ending is better than mending.”

　　green corduroy shorts and white viscose-woollen stockings turned down below the knee.

　　“then came the famous british museum massacre. two thousand culture fans gassed with dichlorethyl sulphide.”

　　a green-and-white jockey cap shaded lenina’s eyes； her shoes were bright green and highly polished.

　　“in the end，” said mustapha mond， “the controllers realized that force was no good. the slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis， neo-pavlovian conditioning and hypnop？dia…”

　　and round her waist she wore a silver-mounted green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt， bulging （for lenina was not a freemartin） with the regulation supply of contraceptives.

　　“the discoveries of pfitzner and kawaguchi were at last made use of. an intensive propaganda against viviparous reproduction…”

　　“perfect！” cried fanny enthusiastically. she could never resist lenina’s charm for long. “and what a perfectly sweet malthusian belt！”

　　“accompanied by a campaign against the past； by the closing of museums， the blowing up of historical monuments （luckily most of them had already been destroyed during the nine years’ war）； by the suppression of all books published before a.f. 150.”

　　“i simply must get one like it，” said fanny.

　　“there were some things called the pyramids， for example.

　　“my old black-patent bandolier…”

　　“and a man called shakespeare. you’ve never heard of them of course.”

　　“it’s an absolute disgrace–that bandolier of mine.”

第43章 Chapter Three(6)


　　“such are the advantages of a really scientific education.”

　　“the more stitches the less riches； the more stitches the less…”

　　“the introduction of our ford’s first t-model…”

　　“i’ve had it nearly three months.”

　　“chosen as the opening date of the new era.”

　　“ending is better than mending； ending is better…”

　　“there was a thing， as i’ve said before， called christianity.”

　　“ending is better than mending.”

　　“the ethics and philosophy of under-consumption…”

　　“i love new clothes， i love new clothes， i love…”

　　“so essential when there was under-production； but in an age of machines and the fixation of nitrogen–positively a crime against society.”

　　“henry foster gave it me.”

　　“all crosses had their tops cut and became t’s. there was also a thing called god.”

　　“it’s real morocco-surrogate.”

　　“we have the world state now. and ford’s day celebrations， and community sings， and solidarity services.”

　　“ford， how i hate them！” bernard marx was thinking.

　　“there was a thing called heaven； but all the same they used to drink enormous quantities of alcohol.”

　　“like meat， like so much meat.”

　　“there was a thing called the soul and a thing called immortality.”

　　“do ask henry where he got it.”

　　“but they used to take morphia and cocaine.”

　　“and what makes it worse， she tlainks of herself as meat.”

　　“two thousand pharmacologists and bio-chemists were subsidized in a.p. 178.”

　　“he does look glum，” said the assistant predestinator， pointing at bernard marx.

　　“six years later it was being produced commercially. the perfect drug.”

　　“let’s bait him.”

　　“euphoric， narcotic， pleasantly hallucinant.”

　　“glum， marx， glum.” the clap on the shoulder made him start， look up. it was that brute henry foster. “what you need is a gramme of soma.”

　　“all the advantages of christianity and alcohol； none of their defects.”

　　“ford， i should like to kill him！” but all he did was to say， “no， thank you，” and fend off the proffered tube of tablets.

　　“take a holiday from reality whenever you like， and come back without so much as a headache or a mythology.”

　　“take it，” insisted henry foster， “take it.”

　　“stability was practically assured.”

　　“one cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments，” said the assistant predestinator citing a piece of homely hypnop？dic wisdom.

　　“it only remained to conquer old age.”

　　“damn you， damn you！” shouted bernard marx.

　　“hoity-toity.”

　　“gonadal hormones， transfusion of young blood， magnesium salts…”

　　“and do remember that a gramme is better than a damn.” they went out， laughing.

　　“all the physiological stigmata of old age have been abolished. and along with them， of course…”

　　“don’t forget to ask him about that malthusian belt，” said fanny.

　　“along with them all the old man’s mental peculiarities. characters remain constant throughout a whole lifetime.”

　　“…two rounds of obstacle golf to get through before dark. i must fly.”

　　“work， play–at sixty our powers and tastes are what they were at seventeen. old men in the bad old days used to renounce， retire， take to religion， spend their time reading， thinking–thinking！”

　　“idiots， swine！” bernard marx was saying to himself， as he walked down the corridor to the lift.

　　“now–such is progress–the old men work， the old men copulate， the old men have no time， no leisure from pleasure， not a moment to sit down and think–or if ever by some unlucky chance such a crevice of time shoud yawn in the solid substance of their distractions， there is always soma， delicious soma， half a gramme for a half-holiday， a gramme for a week-end， two grammes for a trip to the gorgeous east， three for a dark eternity on the moon； returning whence they find themselves on the other side of the crevice， safe on the solid ground of daily labour and distraction， scampering from feely to feely， from girl to pneumatic girl， from electromagnetic golf course to…”

　　“go away， little girl，” shouted the d.h.c. angrily. “go away， little boy！ can’t you see that his fordship’s busy？ go and do your erotic play somewhere else.”

　　“suffer little children，” said the controller.

　　slowly， majestically， with a faint humming of machinery， the conveyors moved forward， thirty-three centimters an hour. in the red darkness glinted innumerable rubies.

第44章 Chapter Four(1)


　　the lift was crowded with men from the alpha changing rooms， and lenina’s entry wars greeted by many friendly nods and smiles. she was a popular girl and， at one time or another， had spent a night with almost all of them.

　　they were dear boys， she thought， as she returned their salutations. charming boys！ still， she did wish that george edzel’s ears weren’t quite so big （perhaps he’d been given just a spot too much parathyroid at metre 328？）. and looking at benito hoover， she couldn’t help remembering that he was really too hairy when he took his clothes off.

　　turning， with eyes a little saddened by the recollection， of benito’s curly blackness， she saw in a corner the small thin body， the melancholy face of bernard marx.

　　“bernard！” she stepped up to him. “i was looking for you.” her voice rang clear above the hum of the mounting lift. the others looked round curiously. “i wanted to talk to you about our new mexico plan.” out of the tail of her eye she could see benito hoover gaping with astonishment. the gape annoyed her. “surprised i shouldn’t be begging to go with him again！” she said to herself. then aloud， and more warmly than ever， “i’d simply love to come with you for a week in july，” she went on. （anyhow， she was publicly proving her unfaithfulness to henry. fanny ought to be pleased， even though it was bernard.） “that is，” lenina gave him her most deliciously significant smile， “if you still want to have me.”

　　bernard’s pale face flushed. “what on earth for？” she wondered， astonished， but at the same time touched by this strange tribute to her power.

　　“hadn’t we better talk about it somewhere else？” he stammered， looking horribly uncomfortable.

　　“as though i’d been saying something shocking，” thought lenina. “he couldn’t look more upset if i’d made a dirty joke–asked him who his mother was， or something like that.”

　　“i mean， with all these people about…” he was choked with confusion.

　　lenina’s laugh was frank and wholly unmalicious. “how funny you are！” she said； and she quite genuinely did think him funny. “you’ll give me at least a week’s warning， won’t you，” she went on in another tone. “i suppose we take the blue pacific rocket？ does it start from the charing-t tower？ or is it from hampstead？”

　　before bernard could answer， the lift came to a standstill.

　　“roof！” called a creaking voice.

　　the liftman was a small simian creature， dressed in the black tunic of an epsilon-minus semi-moron.

　　“roof！”

　　he flung open the gates. the warm glory of afternoon sunlight made him start and blink his eyes. “oh， roof！” he repeated in a voice of rapture. he was as though suddenly and joyfully awakened from a dark annihilating stupor. “roof！”

　　he smiled up with a kind of doggily expectant adoration into the faces of his passengers. talking and laughing together， they stepped out into the light. the liftman looked after them.

　　“roof？” he said once more， questioningly.

　　then a bell rang， and from the ceiling of the lift a loud speaker began， very softly and yet very imperiously， to issue its commands.

　　“go down，” it said， “go down. floor eighteen. go down， go down. floor eighteen. go down， go…”

　　the liftman slammed the gates， touched a button and instantly dropped back into the droning twilight of the well， the twilight of his own habitual stupor.

　　it was warm and bright on the roof. the summer afternoon was drowsy with the hum of passing helicopters； and the deeper drone of the rocket-planes hastening， invisible， through the bright sky five or six miles overhead was like a caress on the soft air. bernard marx drew a deep breath. he looked up into the sky and round the blue horizon and finally down into lenina’s face.

　　“isn’t it beautiful！” his voice trembled a little.

　　she smiled at him with an expression of the most sympathetic understanding. “simply perfect for obstacle golf，” she answered rapturously. “and now i must fly， bernard. henry gets cross if i keep him waiting. let me know in good time about the date.” and waving her hand she ran away across the wide flat roof towards the hangars. bernard stood watching the retreating twinkle of the white stockings， the sunburnt knees vivaciously bending and unbending again， again， and the softer rolling of those well-fitted corduroy shorts beneath the bottle green jacket. his face wore an expression of pain.

　　“i should say she was pretty，” said a loud and cheery voice just behind him.

　　bernard started and looked around. the chubby red face of benito hoover was beaming down at him–beaming with manifest cordiality. benito was notoriously good-natured. people said of him that he could have got through life without ever touching soma. the malice and bad tempers from which other people had to take holidays never afflicted him. reality for benito was always sunny.

　　“pneumatic too. and how！” then， in another tone： “but， i say，” he went on， “you do look glum！ what you need is a gramme of soma.” diving into his right-hand trouser-pocket， benito produced a phial. “one cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy…but， i say！”

　　bernard had suddenly turned and rushed away.

　　benito stared after him. “what can be the matter with the fellow？” he wondered， and， shaking his head， decided that the story about the alcohol having been put into the poor chap’s blood-surrogate must be true. “touched his brain， i suppose.”

　　he put away the soma bottle， and taking out a packet of sex-hormone chewing-gum， stuffed a plug into his cheek and walked slowly away towards the hangars， ruminating.

　　henry foster had had his machine wheeled out of its lock-up and， when lenina arrived， was already seated in the cockpit， waiting.

　　“four minutes late，” was all his comment， as she climbed in beside him. he started the engines and threw the helicopter screws into gear. the machine shot vertically into the air. henry accelerated； the humming of the propeller shrilled from hornet to wasp， from wasp to mosquito； the speedometer showed that they were rising at the best part of two kilometres a minute. london diminished beneath them. the huge table-topped buildings were no more， in a few seconds， than a bed of geometrical mushrooms sprouting from the green of park and garden. in the midst of them， thin-stalked， a taller， slenderer fungus， the charing-t tower lifted towards the sky a disk of shining concrete.

　　like the vague torsos of fabulous athletes， huge fleshy clouds lolled on the blue air above their heads. out of one of them suddenly dropped a small scarlet insect， buzzing as it fell.

　　“there’s the red rocket，” said henry， “just come in from new york.” looking at his watch. “seven minutes behind time，” he added， and shook his head. “these atlantic services–they’re really scandalously unpunctual.”

　　he took his foot off the accelerator. the humming of the screws overhead dropped an octave and a half， back through wasp and hornet to bumble bee， to cockchafer， to stag-beetle. the upward rush of the machine slackened off； a moment later they were hanging motionless in the air. henry pushed at a lever； there was a click. slowly at first， then faster and faster， till it was a circular mist before their eyes， the propeller in front of them began to revolve. the wind of a horizontal speed whistled ever more shrilly in the stays. henry kept his eye on the revolution-counter； when the needle touched the twelve hundred mark， he threw the helicopter screws out of gear. the machine had enough forward momentum to be able to fly on its planes.

　　lenina looked down through the window in the floor between her feet. they were flying over the six kilometre zone of park-land that separated central london from its first ring of satellite suburbs. the green was maggoty with fore-shortened life. forests of centrifugal bumble-puppy towers gleamed between the trees. near shepherd’s bush two thousand beta-minus mixed doubles were playing riemann-surface tennis. a double row of escalator fives courts lined the main road from notting hill to willesden. in the ealing stadium a delta gymnastic display and community sing was in progress.

　　“what a hideous colour khaki is，” remarked lenina， voicing the hypnop？dic prejudices of her caste.

　　the buildings of the hounslow feely studio covered seven and a half hectares. near them a black and khaki army of labourers was busy revitrifying the surface of the great west road. one of the huge travelling crucibles was being tapped as they flew over. the molten stone poured out in a stream of dazzling incandescence across the road， the asbestos rollers came and went； at the tail of an insulated watering cart the steam rose in white clouds.

　　at brentford the television corporation’s factory was like a small town.

　　“they must be changing the shift，” said lenina.

　　like aphides and ants， the leaf-green gamma girls， the black semi-morons swarmed round the entrances， or stood in queues to take their places in the monorail tram-cars. mulberry-coloured beta-minuses came and went among the crowd. the roof of the main building was alive with the alighting and departure of helicopters.

　　“my word，” said lenina， “i’m glad i’m not a gamma.”

　　ten minutes later they were at stoke poges and had started their first round of obstacle golf.

　　with eyes for the most part downcast and， if ever they lighted on a fellow creature， at once and furtively averted， bernard hastened across the roof. he was like a man pursued， but pursued by enemies he does not wish to see， lest they should seem more hostile even than he had supposed， and he himself be made to feel guiltier and even more helplessly alone.

　　“that horrible benito hoover！” and yet the man had meant well enough. which only made it， in a way， much worse. those who meant well behaved in the same way as those who meant badly. even lenina was making him suffer. he remembered those weeks of timid indecision， during which he had looked and longed and despaired of ever having the courage to ask her. dared he face the risk of being humiliated by a contemptuous refusal？ but if she were to say yes， what rapture！ well， now she had said it and he was still wretched–wretched that she should have thought it such a perfect afternoon for obstacle golf， that she should have trotted away to join henry foster， that she should have found him funny for not wanting to talk of their most private affairs in public. wretched， in a word， because she had behaved as any healthy and virtuous english girl ought to behave and not in some other， abnormal， extraordinary way.

　　he opened the door of his lock-up and called to a lounging couple of delta-minus attendants to come and push his machine out on to the roof. the hangars were staffed by a single bokanovsky group， and the men were twins， identically small， black and hideous. bernard gave his orders in the sharp， rather arrogant and even offensive tone of one who does not feel himself too secure in his superiority. to have dealings with members of the lower castes was always， for bernard， a most distressing experience. for whatever the cause （and the current gossip about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate may very likely–for accidents will happen–have been true） bernard’s physique as hardly better than that of the average gamma. he stood eight centimetres short of the standard alpha height and was slender in proportion. contact with members of he lower castes always reminded him painfully of this physical inadequacy. “i am i， and wish i wasn’t”； his self-consciousness was acute and stressing. each time he found himself looking on the level， instead of downward， into a delta’s face， he felt humiliated. would the creature treat him with the respect due to his caste？ the question haunted him. not without reason. for gammas， deltas and epsilons had been to some extent conditioned to associate corporeal mass with social superiority. indeed， a faint hypnop？dic prejudice in favour of size was universal. hence the laughter of the women to whom he made proposals， the practical joking of his equals among the men. the mockery made him feel an outsider； and feeling an outsider he behaved like one， which increased the prejudice against him and intensified the contempt and hostility aroused by his physical defects. which in turn increased his sense of being alien and alone. a chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals， made him stand， where his inferiors were concerned， self-consciously on his dignity. how bitterly he envied men like henry foster and benito hoover！ men who never had to shout at an epsilon to get an order obeyed； men who took their position for granted； men who moved through the caste system as a fish through water–so utterly at home as to be unaware either of themselves or of the beneficent and comfortable element in which they had their being.

　　slackly， it seemed to him， and with reluctance， the twin attendants wheeled his plane out on the roof.

　　“hurry up！” said bernard irritably. one of them glanced at him. was that a kind of bestial derision that he detected in those blank grey eyes？ “hurry up！” he shouted more loudly， and there was an ugly rasp in his voice.

　　he climbed into the plane and， a minute later， was flying southwards， towards the river.

　　the various bureaux of propaganda and the college of emotional engineering were housed in a single sixty-story building in fleet street. in the basement and on the low floors were the presses and offices of the three great lodon newspapers–the hourly radio， an upper-caste sheet， the pale green gamma gazette， and， on khaki paper and in words exclusively of one syllable， the delta mirror. then came the bureaux of propaganda by television， by feeling picture， and by synthetic voice and music respectively–twenty-two floors of them. above were the search laboratories and the padded rooms in which sound-track writers and synthetic composers did the delicate work. the top eighteen floors were occupied the college of emotional engineering.

　　bernard landed on the roof of propaganda house and stepped out.

　　“ring down to mr. helmholtz watson，” he ordered the gamma-plus porter， “and tell him that mr. bernard marx is waiting for him on the roof.”

　　he sat down and lit a cigarette.

　　helmholtz watson was writing when the message came down.

　　“tell him i’m coming at once，” he said and hung up the receiver. then， turning to his secretary， “i’ll leave you to put my things away，” he went on in the same official and impersonal tone； and， ignoring her lustrous smile， got up and walked briskly to the door.

　　he was a powerfully built man， deep-chested， broad-shouldered， massive， and yet quick in his movements， springy and agile. the round strong pillar of his neck supported a beautifully shaped head. his hair was dark and curly， his features strongly marked. in a forcible emphatic way， he was handsome and looked， as his secretety was never tired of repeating， every centimetre an alpha plus. by profession he was a lecturer at the college of emotional engineering （department of writing） and the intervals of his educational activities， a working emotional engineer. he wrote regularly for the hourly radio， composed feely scenarios， and had the happiest knack for slogans and hypnop？dic rhymes.

　　“able，” was the verdict of his superiors. “perhaps， （and they would shake their heads， would significantly lower their voices） a little too able.”

第47章 Chapter Four(4)


　　yes， a little too able； they were right. a mental excess had produced in helmholtz watson effects very similar to those which， in bernard marx， were the result of a physical defect. too little bone and brawn had isolated bernard from his fellow men， and the sense of this apartness， being， by all the current standards， a mental excess， became in its turn a cause of wider separation. that which had made helmholtz so uncomfortably aware of being himself and and all alone was too much ability. what the two men shared was the knowledge that they were individuals. but whereas the physically defective bernard had suffered all his life from the consciousness of being separate， it was only quite recently that， grown aware of his mental excess， helmholtz watson had also become aware of his difference from the people who surrounded him. this escalator-squash champion， this indefatigable lover （it was said that he had had six hundred and forty different girls in under four years）， this admirable committee man and best mixer had realized quite suddenly that sport， women， communal activities were only， so far as he was concerned， second bests. really， and at the bottom， he was interested in something else. but in what？ in what？ that was the problem which bernard had come to discuss with him–or rather， since it was always helmholtz who did all the talking， to listen to his friend discussing， yet once more.

　　three charming girls from the bureau of propaganda by synthetic voice waylaid him as he stepped out of the lift.

　　“oh， helmholtz， darling， do come and have a picnic supper with us on exmoor.” they clung round him imploringly.

　　he shook his head， he pushed his way through them. “no， no.”

　　“we’re not inviting any other man.”

　　but helmholtz remained unshaken even by this delightful promise. “no，” he repeated， “i’m busy.” and he held resolutely on his course. the girls trailed after him. it was not till he had actually climbed into bernard’s plane and slammed the door that they gave up pursuit. not without reproaches.

　　“these women！” he said， as the machine rose into the air. “these women！” and he shook his head， he frowned. “too awful，” bernard hypocritically agreed， wishing， as he spoke the words， that he could have as many girls as helmholtz did， and with as little trouble. he was seized with a sudden urgent need to boast. “i’m taking lenina crowne to new mexico with me，” he said in a tone as casual as he could make it.

　　“are you？” said helmholtz， with a total absence of interest. then after a little pause， “this last week or two，” he went on， “i’ve been cutting all my committees and all my girls. you can’t imagine what a hullabaloo they’ve been making about it at the college. still， it’s been worth it， i think. the effects…” he hesitated. “well， they’re odd， they’re very odd.”

　　a physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. the process， it seemed， was reversible. mental excess could produce， for its own purposes， the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude， the artificial impotence of asceticism.

　　the rest of the short flight was accomplished in silence. when they had arrived and were comfortably stretched out on the pneumatic sofas in bernard’s room， helmholtz began again.

　　speaking very slowly， “did you ever feel，” he asked， “as though you had something inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out？ some sort of extra power that you aren’t using–you know， like all the water that goes down the falls instead of through the turbines？” he looked at bernard questioningly.

　　“you mean all the emotions one might be feeling if things were different？”

　　helmholtz shook his head. “not quite. i’m thinking of a queer feeling i sometimes get， a feeling that i’ve got something important to say and the power to say it–only i don’t know what it is， and i can’t make any use of the power. if there was some different way of writing…or else something else to write about…” he was silent； then， “you see，” he went on at last， “i’m pretty good at inventing phrases–you know， the sort of words that suddenly make you jump， almost as though you’d sat on a pin， they seem so new and exciting even though they’re about something hypnop？dically obvious. but that doesn’t seem enough. it’s not enough for the phrases to be good； what you make with them ought to be good too.”

　　“but your things are good， helmholtz.”

　　“oh， as far as they go.” helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. “but they go such a little way. they aren’t important enough， somehow. i feel i could do something much more important. yes， and more intense， more violent. but what？ what is there more important to say？ and how can one be violent about the sort of things one’s expected to write about？ words can be like x-rays， if you use them properly–they’ll go through anything. you read and you’re pierced. that’s one of the things i try to teach my students–how to write piercingly. but what on earth’s the good of being pierced by an article about a community sing， or the latest improvement in scent organs？ besides， can you make words really piercing–you know， like the very hardest x-rays–when you’re writing about that sort of thing？ can you say something about nothing？ that’s what it finally boils down to. i try and i try…”

　　“hush！” said bernard suddenly， and lifted a warning finger； they listened. “i believe there’s somebody at the door，” he whispered.

　　helmholtz got up， tiptoed across the room， and with a sharp quick movement flung the door wide open. there was， of course， nobody there.

　　“i’m sorry，” said bernard， feelling and looking uncomfortably foolish. “i suppose i’ve got things on my nerves a bit. when people are suspicious with you， you start being suspicious with them.”

　　he passed his hand across his eyes， he sighed， his voice became plaintive. he was justifying himself. “if you knew what i’d had to put up with recently，” he said almost tearfully–and the uprush of his self-pity was like a fountain suddenly released. “if you only knew！”

　　helmholtz watson listened with a certain sense of discomfort. “poor little bernard！” he said to himself. but at the same time he felt rather ashamed for his friend. he wished bernard would show a little more pride.

第48章 Chapter Five(1)


　　by eight o’clock the light was failing. the loud speaker in the tower of the stoke poges club house began， in a more than human tenor， to announce the closing of the courses. lenina and henry abandoned their game and walked back towards the club. from the grounds of the internal and external secretion trust came the lowing of those thousands of cattle which provided， with their hormones and their milk， the raw materials for the great factory at farnham royal.

　　an incessant buzzing of helicopters filled the twilight. every two and a half minutes a bell and the screech of whistles announced the departure of one of the light monorail trains which carried the lower caste golfers back from their separate course to the metropolis.

　　lenina and henry climbed into their machine and started off. at eight hundred feet henry slowed down the helicopter screws， and they hung for a minute or two poised above the fading landscape. the forest of burnham beeches stretched like a great pool of darkness towards the bright shore of the western sky. crimson at the horizon， the last of the sunset faded， through orange， upwards into yellow and a pale watery green. northwards， beyond and above the trees， the internal and external secretions factory glared with a fierce electric brilliance from every window of its twenty stories. beneath them lay the buildings of the golf club–the huge lower caste barracks and， on the other side of a dividing wall， the smaller houses reserved for alpha and beta members. the approaches to the monorail station were black with the ant-like pullulation of lower-caste activity. from under the glass vault a lighted train shot out into the open. following its southeasterly course across the dark plain their eyes were drawn to the majestic buildings of the slough crematorium. for the safety of night-flying planes， its four tall chimneys were flood-lighted and tipped with crimson danger signals. it was a landmark.

　　“why do the smoke-stacks have those things like balconies around them？” enquired lenina.

　　“phosphorus recovery，” explained henry telegraphically. “on their way up the chimney the gases go through four separate treatments. p2o5 used to go right out of circulation every time they cremated some one. now they recover over ninety-eight per cent of it. more than a kilo and a half per adult corpse. which makes the best part of four hundred tons of phosphorus every year from england alone.” henry spoke with a happy pride， rejoicing whole-heartedly in the achievement， as though it had been his own. “fine to think we can go on being socially useful even after we’re dead. making plants grow.”

　　lenina， meanwhile， had turned her eyes away and was looking perpendicularly downwards at the monorail station. “fine，” she agreed. “but queer that alphas and betas won’t make any more plants grow than those nasty little gammas and deltas and epsilons down there.”

　　“all men are physico-chemically equal，” said henry sententiously. “besides， even epsilons perform indispensable services.”

　　“even an epsilon…” lenina suddenly remembered an occasion when， as a little girl at school， she had woken up in the middle of the night and become aware， for the first time， of the whispering that had haunted all her sleeps. she saw again the beam of moonlight， the row of small white beds； heard once more the soft， soft voice that said （the words were there， unforgotten， unforgettable after so many night-long repetitions）： “every one works for every one else. we can’t do without any one. even epsilons are useful. we couldn’t do without epsilons. every one works for every one else. we can’t do without any one…” lenina remembered her first shock of fear and surprise； her speculations through half a wakeful hour； and then， under the influence of those endless repetitions， the gradual soothing of her mind， the soothing， the smoothing， the stealthy creeping of sleep.…

　　“i suppose epsilons don’t really mind being epsilons，” she said aloud.

　　“of course they don’t. how can they？ they don’t know what it’s like being anything else. we’d mind， of course. but then we’ve been differently conditioned. besides， we start with a different heredity.”

　　“i’m glad i’m not an epsilon，” said lenina， with conviction.

　　“and if you were an epsilon，” said henry， “your conditioning would have made you no less thankful that you weren’t a beta or an alpha.” he put his forward propeller into gear and headed the machine towards london. behind them， in the west， the crimson and orange were almost faded； a dark bank of cloud had crept into the zenith. as they flew over the crematorium， the plane shot upwards on the column of hot air rising from the chimneys， only to fall as suddenly when it passed into the descending chill beyond.

　　“what a marvellous switchback！” lenina laughed delightedly.

　　but henry’s tone was almost， for a moment， melancholy. “do you know what that switchback was？” he said. “it was some human being finally and definitely disappearing. going up in a squirt of hot gas. it would be curious to know who it was–a man or a woman， an alpha or an epsilon.…” he sighed. then， in a resolutely cheerful voice， “anyhow，” he concluded， “there’s one thing we can be certain of； whoever he may have been， he was happy when he was alive. everybody’s happy now.”

　　“yes， everybody’s happy now，” echoed lenina. they had heard the words repeated a hundred and fifty times every night for twelve years.

　　landing on the roof of henry’s forty-story apartment house in westminster， they went straight down to the dining-hall. there， in a loud and cheerful company， they ate an excellent meal. soma was served with the coffee. lenina took two half-gramme tablets and henry three. at twenty past nine they walked across the street to the newly opened westminster abbey cabaret. it was a night almost without clouds， moonless and starry； but of this on the whole depressing fact lenina and henry were fortunately unaware. the electric sky-signs effectively shut off the outer darkness. “calvin stopes and his sixteen sexophonists.” from the fa？ade of the new abbey the giant letters invitingly glared. “london’s finest scent and colour organ. all the latest synthetic music.”

第49章 Chapter Five(2)


　　they entered. the air seemed hot and somehow breathless with the scent of ambergris and sandalwood. on the domed ceiling of the hall， the colour organ had momentarily painted a tropical sunset. the sixteen sexophonists were playing an old favourite： “there ain’t no bottle in all the world like that dear little bottle of mine.” four hundred couples were five-stepping round the polished floor. lenina and henry were soon the four hundred and first. the saxophones wailed like melodious cats under the moon， moaned in the alto and tenor registers as though the little death were upon them. rich with a wealth of harmonics， their tremulous chorus mounted towards a climax， louder and ever louder–until at last， with a wave of his hand， the conductor let loose the final shattering note of ether-music and blew the sixteen merely human blowers clean out of existence. thunder in a flat major. and then， in all but silence， in all but darkness， there followed a gradual deturgescence， a diminuendo sliding gradually， through quarter tones， down， down to a faintly whispered dominant chord that lingered on （while the five-four rhythms still pulsed below） charging the darkened seconds with an intense expectancy. and at last expectancy was fulfilled. there was a sudden explosive sunrise， and simultaneously， the sixteen burst into song：

　　“bottle of mine， it’s you i’ve always wanted！

　　bottle of mine， why was i ever decanted？

　　skies are blue inside of you，

　　the weather’s always fine； for there ain’t no bottle in all the world like that dear little bottle of mine.”

　　five-stepping with the other four hundred round and round westminster abbey， lenina and henry were yet dancing in another world–the warm， the richly coloured， the infinitely friendly world of soma-holiday. how kind， how good-looking， how delightfully amusing every one was！ “bottle of mine， it’s you i’ve always wanted…” but lenina and henry had what they wanted…they were inside， here and now-safely inside with the fine weather， the perennially blue sky. and when， exhausted， the sixteen had laid by their saxophones and the synthetic music apparatus was producing the very latest in slow malthusian blues， they might have been twin embryos gently rocking together on the waves of a bottled ocean of blood-surrogate.

　　“good-night， dear friends. good-night， dear friends.” the loud speakers veiled their commands in a genial and musical politeness. “good-night， dear friends…”

　　obediently， with all the others， lenina and henry left the building. the depressing stars had travelled quite some way across the heavens. but though the separating screen of the sky-signs had now to a great extent dissolved， the two young people still retained their happy ignorance of the night.

　　swallowing half an hour before closing time， that second dose of soma had raised a quite impenetrable wall between the actual universe and their minds. bottled， they crossed the street； bottled， they took the lift up to henry’s room on the twenty-eighth floor. and yet， bottled as she was， and in spite of that second gramme of soma， lenina did not forget to take all the contraceptive precautions prescribed by the regulations. years of intensive hypnop？dia and， from twelve to seventeen， malthusian drill three times a week had made the taking of these precautions almost as automatic and inevitable as blinking.

　　“oh， and that reminds me，” she said， as she came back from the bathroom， “fanny crowne wants to know where you found that lovely green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt you gave me.”

　　alternate thursdays were bernard’s solidarity service days. after an early dinner at the aphroditzeum （to which helrnholtz had recently been elected under rule two） he took leave of his friend and， hailing a taxi on the roof told the man to fly to the fordson community singery. the machine rose a couple of hundred metres， then headed eastwards， and as it turned， there before bernard’s eyes， gigantically beautiful， was the singery. flood-lighted， its three hundred and twenty metres of white carrara-surrogate gleamed with a snowy incandescence over ludgate hill； at each of the four corners of its helicopter platform an immense t shone crimson against the night， and from the mouths of twenty-four vast golden trumpets rumbled a solemn synthetic music.

　　“damn， i’m late，” bernard said to himself as he first caught sight of big henry， the singery clock. and sure enough， as he was paying off his cab， big henry sounded the hour. “ford，” sang out an immense bass voice from all the golden trumpets. “ford， ford， ford…” nine times. bernard ran for the lift.

　　the great auditorium for ford’s day celebrations and other massed community sings was at the bottom of the building. above it， a hundred to each floor， were the seven thousand rooms used by solidarity groups for their fortnight services. bernard dropped down to floor thirty-three， hurried along the corridor， stood hesitating for a moment outside room 3210， then， having wound himself up， opened the door and walked in.

　　thank ford！ he was not the last. three chairs of the twelve arranged round the circular table were still unoccupied. he slipped into the nearest of them as inconspicuously as he could and prepared to frown at the yet later comers whenever they should arrive.

　　turning towards him， “what were you playing this afternoon？” the girl on his left enquired. “obstacle， or electro-magnetic？”

　　bernard looked at her （ford！ it was morgana rothschild） and blushingly had to admit that he had been playing neither. morgana stared at him with astonishment. there was an awkward silence.

　　then pointedly she turned away and addressed herself to the more sporting man on her left.

第50章 Chapter Five(3)


　　“a good beginning for a solidarity service，” thought bernard miserably， and foresaw for himself yet another failure to achieve atonement. if only he had given himself time to look around instead of scuttling for the nearest chair！ he could have sat between fifi bradlaugh and joanna diesel. instead of which he had gone and blindly planted himself next to morgana. morgana！ ford！ those black eyebrows of hers–that eyebrow， rather–for they met above the nose. ford！ and on his right was clara deterding. true， clara’s eyebrows didn’t meet. but she was really too pneumatic. whereas fifi and joanna were absolutely right. plump， blonde， not too large…and it was that great lout， tom kawaguchi， who now took the seat between them.

　　the last arrival was sarojini engels.

　　“you’re late，” said the president of the group severely. “don’t let it happen again.”

　　sarojini apologized and slid into her place between jim bokanovsky and herbert bakunin. the group was now complete， the solidarity circle perfect and without flaw. man， woman， man， in a ring of endless alternation round the table. twelve of them ready to be made one， waiting to come together， to be fused， to lose their twelve separate identities in a larger being.

　　the president stood up， made the sign of the t and， switching on the synthetic music， let loose the soft indefatigable beating of drums and a choir of instruments–near-wind and super-string–that plangently repeated and repeated the brief and unescapably haunting melody of the first solidarity hymn. again， again–and it was not the ear that heard the pulsing rhythm， it was the midriff； the wail and clang of those recurring harmonies haunted， not the mind， but the yearning bowels of compassion.

　　the president made another sign of the t and sat down. the service had begun. the dedicated soma tablets were placed in the centre of the table. the loving cup of strawberry ice-cream soma was passed from hand to hand and， with the formula， “i drink to my annihilation，” twelve times quaffed. then to the accompaniment of the synthetic orchestra the first solidarity hymn was sung.

　　“ford， we are twelve； oh， make us one，

　　like drops within the social river， oh， make us now together run

　　as swiftly as thy shining flivver.”

　　twelve yearning stanzas. and then the loving cup was passed a second time. “i drink to the greater being” was now the formula. all drank. tirelessly the music played. the drums beat. the crying and clashing of the harmonies were an obsession in the melted bowels. the second solidarity hymn was sung.

　　“come， greater being， social friend，

　　annihilating twelve-in-one！ we long to die， for when we end，

　　our larger life has but begun.”

　　again twelve stanzas. by this time the soma had begun to work. eyes shone， cheeks were flushed， the inner light of universal benevolence broke out on every face in happy， friendly smiles. even bernard felt himself a little melted. when morgana rothschild turned and beamed at him， he did his best to beam back. but the eyebrow， that black two-in-one–alas， it was still there； he couldn’t ignore it， couldn’t， however hard he tried. the melting hadn’t gone far enough. perhaps if he had been sitting between fifi and joanna…for the third time the loving cup went round； “i drink to the imminence of his coming，” said morgana rothschild， whose turn it happened to be to initiate the circular rite. her tone was loud， exultant. she drank and passed the cup to bernard. “i drink to the imminence of his coming，” he repeated， with a sincere attempt to feel that the coming was imminent； but the eyebrow continued to haunt him， and the coming， so far as he was concerned， was horribly remote. he drank and handed the cup to clara deterding. “it’ll be a failure again，” he said to himself. “i know it will.” but he went on doing his best to beam.

　　the loving cup had made its circuit. lifting his hand， the president gave a signal； the chorus broke out into the third solidarity hymn.

　　“feel how the greater being comes！

　　rejoice and， in rejoicings， die！ melt in the music of the drums！

第51章 Chapter Five(4)


　　as verse succeeded verse the voices thrilled with an ever intenser excitement. the sense of the coming’s imminence was like an electric tension in the air. the president switched off the music and， with the final note of the final stanza， there was absolute silence–the silence of stretched expectancy， quivering and creeping with a galvanic life. the president reached out his hand； and suddenly a voice， a deep strong voice， more musical than any merely human voice， richer， warmer， more vibrant with love and yearning and compassion， a wonderful， mysterious， supernatural voice spoke from above their heads. very slowly， “oh， ford， ford， ford，” it said diminishingly and on a descending scale. a sensation of warmth radiated thrillingly out from the solar plexus to every extremity of the bodies of those who listened； tears came into their eyes； their hearts， their bowels seemed to move within them， as though with an independent life. “ford！” they were melting， “ford！” dissolved， dissolved. then， in another tone， suddenly， startlingly. “listen！” trumpeted the voice. “listen！” they listened. after a pause， sunk to a whisper， but a whisper， somehow， more penetrating than the loudest cry. “the feet of the greater being，” it went on， and repeated the words： “the feet of the greater being.” the whisper almost expired. “the feet of the greater being are on the stairs.” and once more there was silence； and the expectancy， momentarily relaxed， was stretched again， tauter， tauter， almost to the tearing point. the feet of the greater being–oh， they heard thern， they heard them， coming softlydown the stairs， coming nearer and nearer down the invisible stairs. the feet of the greater being. and suddenly the tearing point was reached. her eyes staring， her lips parted. morgana rothschild sprang to her feet.

　　“i hear him，” she cried. “i hear him.”

　　“he’s coming，” shouted sarojini engels.

　　“yes， he’s coming， i hear him.” fifi bradlaugh and tom kawaguchi rose simultaneously to their feet.

　　“oh， oh， oh！” joanna inarticulately testified.

　　“he’s coming！” yelled jim bokanovsky.

　　the president leaned forward and， with a touch， released a delirium of cymbals and blown brass， a fever of tom-tomming.

　　“oh， he’s coming！” screamed clara deterding. “aie！” and it was as though she were having her throat cut.

　　feeling that it was time for him to do something， bernard also jumped up and shouted： “i hear him； he’s coming.” but it wasn’t true. he heard nothing and， for him， nobody was coming. nobody–in spite of the music， in spite of the mounting excitement. but he waved his arms， he shouted with the best of them； and when the others began to jig and stamp and shuffle， he also jigged and shuffled.

　　round they went， a circular procession of dancers， each with hands on the hips of the dancer preceding， round and round， shouting in unison， stamping to the rhythm of the music with their feet， beating it， beating it out with hands on the buttocks in front； twelve pairs of hands beating as one； as one， twelve buttocks slabbily resounding. twelve as one， twelve as one. “i hear him， i hear him coming.” the music quickened； faster beat the feet， faster， faster fell the rhythmic hands. and all at once a great synthetic bass boomed out the words which announced the approaching atonement and final consummation of solidarity， the coming of the twelve-in-one， the incarnation of the greater being. “orgy-porgy，” it sang， while the tom-toms continued to beat their feverish tattoo：

　　“orgy-porgy， ford and fun， kiss the girls and make them one. boys at one with girls at peace； orgy-porgy gives release.”

　　“orgy-porgy，” the dancers caught up the liturgical refrain， “orgy-porgy， ford and fun， kiss the girls…” and as they sang， the lights began slowly to fade–to fade and at the same time to grow warmer， richer， redder， until at last they were dancing in the crimson twilight of an embryo store. “orgy-porgy…” in their blood-coloured and foetal darkness the dancers continued for a while to circulate， to beat and beat out the indefatigable rhythm. “orgy-porgy…” then the circle wavered， broke， fell in partial disintegration on the ring of couches which surrounded–circle enclosing circle–the table and its planetary chairs. “orgy-porgy…” tenderly the deep voice crooned and cooed； in the red twilight it was as though some enormous negro dove were hovering benevolently over the now prone or supine dancers.

　　they were standing on the roof； big henry had just sung eleven. the night was calm and warm.

　　“wasn’t it wonderful？” said fifi bradlaugh. “wasn’t it simply wonderful？” she looked at bernard with an expression of rapture， but of rapture in which there was no trace of agitation or excitement–for to be excited is still to be unsatisfied. hers was the calm ecstasy of achieved consummation， the peace， not of mere vacant satiety and nothingness， but of balanced life， of energies at rest and in equilibrium. a rich and living peace. for the solidarity service had given as well as taken， drawn off only to replenish. she was full， she was made perfect， she was still more than merely herself. “didn’t you think it was wonderful？” she insisted， looking into bernard’s face with those supernaturally shining eyes.

　　“yes， i thought it was wonderful，” he lied and looked away； the sight of her transfigured face was at once an accusation and an ironical reminder of his own separateness. he was as miserably isolated now as he had been when the service began–more isolated by reason of his unreplenished emptiness， his dead satiety. separate and unatoned， while the others were being fused into the greater being； alone even in morgana’s embrace–much more alone， indeed， more hopelessly himself than he had ever been in his life before. he had emerged from that crimson twilight into the common electric glare with a self-consciousness intensified to the pitch of agony. he was utterly miserable， and perhaps （her shining eyes accused him）， perhaps it was his own fault. “quite wonderful，” he repeated； but the only thing he could think of was morgana’s eyebrow.

第52章 Chapter Six(1)


　　odd， odd， odd， was lenina’s verdict on bernard marx. so odd， indeed， that in the course of the succeeding weeks she had wondered more than once whether she shouldn’t change her mind about the new mexico holiday， and go instead to the north pole with benito hoover. the trouble was that she knew the north pole， had been there with george edzel only last summer， and what was more， found it pretty grim. nothing to do， and the hotel too hopelessly old-fashioned–no television laid on in the bedrooms， no scent organ， only the most putrid synthetic music， and not more than twenty-five escalator-squash courts for over two hundred guests. no， decidedly she couldn’t face the north pole again. added to which， she had only been to america once before. and even then， how inadequately！ a cheap week-end in new york–had it been with jean-jacques habibullah or bokanovsky jones？ she couldn’t remember. anyhow， it was of absolutely no importance. the prospect of flying west again， and for a whole week， was very inviting. moreover， for at least three days of that week they would be in the savage reservation. not more than half a dozen people in the whole centre had ever been inside a savage reservation. as an alpha-plus psychologist， bernard was one of the few men she knew entitled to a permit. for lenina， the opportunity was unique. and yet， so unique also was bernard’s oddness that she had hesitated to take it， had actually thought of risking the pole again with funny old benito. at least benito was normal. whereas bernard…

　　“alcohol in his blood-surrogate，” was fanny’s explanation of every eccentricity. but henry， with whom， one evening when they were in bed together， lenina had rather anxiously discussed her new lover， henry had compared poor bernard to a rhinoceros.

　　“you can’t teach a rhinoceros tricks，” he had explained in his brief and vigorous style. “some men are almost rhinoceroses； they don’t respond properly to conditioning. poor devils！ bernard’s one of them. luckily for him， he’s pretty good at his job. otherwise the director would never have kept him. however，” he added consolingly， “i think he’s pretty harmless.”

　　pretty harmless， perhaps； but also pretty disquieting. that mania， to start with， for doing things in private. which meant， in practice， not doing anything at all. for what was there that one could do in private. （apart， of course， from going to bed： but one couldn’t do that all the time.） yes， what was there？ precious little. the first afternoon they went out together was particularly fine. lenina had suggested a swim at toquay country club followed by dinner at the oxford union. but bernard thought there would be too much of a crowd. then what about a round of electro-magnetic golf at st. andrew’s？ but again， no： bernard considered that electro-magnetic golf was a waste of time.

　　“then what’s time for？” asked lenina in some astonishment.

　　apparently， for going walks in the lake district； for that was what he now proposed. land on the top of skiddaw and walk for a couple of hours in the heather. “alone with you， lenina.”

　　“but， bernard， we shall be alone all night.”

　　bernard blushed and looked away. “i meant， alone for talking，” he mumbled.

　　“talking？ but what about？” walking and talking–that seemed a very odd way of spending an afternoon.

　　in the end she persuaded him， much against his will， to fly over to amsterdam to see the semi-demi-finals of the women’s heavyweight wrestling championship.

　　“in a crowd，” he grumbled. “as usual.” he remained obstinately gloomy the whole afternoon； wouldn’t talk to lenina’s friends （of whom they met dozens in the ice-cream soma bar between the wrestling bouts）； and in spite of his misery absolutely refused to take the half-gramme raspberry sundae which she pressed upon him. “i’d rather be myself，” he said. “myself and nasty. not somebody else， however jolly.”

　　“a gramme in time saves nine，” said lenina， producing a bright treasure of sleep-taught wisdom. bernard pushed away the proffered glass impatiently.

　　“now don’t lose your temper，” she said. “remember one cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments.”

　　“oh， for ford’s sake， be quiet！” he shouted.

　　lenina shrugged her shoulders. “a gramme is always better than a damn，” she concluded with dignity， and drank the sundae herself.

　　on their way back across the channel， bernard insisted on stopping his propeller and hovering on his helicopter screws within a hundred feet of the waves. the weather had taken a change for the worse； a south-westerly wind had sprung up， the sky was cloudy.

　　“look，” he commanded.

　　“but it’s horrible，” said lenina， shrinking back from the window. she was appalled by the rushing emptiness of the night， by the black foam-flecked water heaving beneath them， by the pale face of the moon， so haggard and distracted among the hastening clouds. “let’s turn on the radio. quick！” she reached for the dialling knob on the dash-board and turned it at random.

　　“…skies are blue inside of you，” sang sixteen tremoloing falsettos， “the weather’s always…”

　　then a hiccough and silence. bernard had switched of the current.

　　“i want to look at the sea in peace，” he said. “one can’t even look with that beastly noise going on.”

　　“but it’s lovely. and i don’t want to look.”

　　“but i do，” he insisted. “it makes me feel as though…” he hesitated， searching for words with which to express himself， “as though i were more me， if you see what i mean. more on my own， not so completely a part of something else. not just a cell in the social body. doesn’t it make you feel like that， lenina？”

　　but lenina was crying. “it’s horrible， it’s horrible，” she kept repeating. “and how can you talk like that about not wanting to be a part of the social body？ after all， every one works for every one else. we can’t do without any one. even epsilons…”

　　“yes， i know，” said bernard derisively. “‘even epsilons are useful’！ so am i. and i damned well wish i weren’t！”

　　lenina was shocked by his blasphemy. “bernard！” she protested in a voice of amazed distress. “how can you？”

　　in a different key， “how can i？” he repeated meditatively. “no， the real problem is： how is it that i can’t， or rather–because， after all， i know quite well why i can’t–what would it be like if i could， if i were free–not enslaved by my conditioning.”

　　“but， bernard， you’re saying the most awful things.”

　　“don’t you wish you were free， lenina？”

第53章 Chapter Six(2)


　　“i don’t know what you mean. i am free. free to have the most wonderful time. everybody’s happy nowadays.”

　　he laughed， “yes， ‘everybody’s happy nowadays.’ we begin giving the children that at five. but wouldn’t you like to be free to be happy in some other way， lenina？ in your own way， for example； not in everybody else’s way.”

　　“i don’t know what you mean，” she repeated. then， turning to him， “oh， do let’s go back， bernard，” she besought； “i do so hate it here.”

　　“don’t you like being with me？”

　　“but of course， bernard. it’s this horrible place.”

　　“i thought we’d be more…more together here–with nothing but the sea and moon. more together than in that crowd， or even in my rooms. don’t you understand that？”

　　“i don’t understand anything，” she said with decision， determined to preserve her incomprehension intact. “nothing. least of all，” she continued in another tone， “why you don’t take soma when you have these dreadful ideas of yours. you’d forget all about them. and instead of feeling miserable， you’d be jolly. so jolly，” she repeated and smiled， for all the puzzled anxiety in her eyes， with what was meant to be an inviting and voluptuous cajolery.

　　he looked at her in silence， his face unresponsive and very grave–looked at her intently. after a few seconds lenina’s eyes flinched away； she uttered a nervous little laugh， tried to think of something to say and couldn’t. the silence prolonged itself.

　　when bernard spoke at last， it was in a small tired voice. “all right then，” he said， “we’ll go back.” and stepping hard on the accelerator， he sent the machine rocketing up into the sky. at four thousand he started his propeller. they flew in silence for a minute or two. then， suddenly， bernard began to laugh. rather oddly， lenina thought， but still， it was laughter.

　　“feeling better？” she ventured to ask.

　　for answer， he lifted one hand from the controls and， slipping his arm around her， began to fondle her breasts.

　　“thank ford，” she said to herself， “he’s all right again.”

　　half an hour later they were back in his rooms. bernard swallowed four tablets of soma at a gulp， turned on the radio and television and began to undress.

　　“well，” lenina enquired， with significant archness when they met next afternoon on the roof， “did you think it was fun yesterday？”

　　bernard nodded. they climbed into the plane. a little jolt， and they were off.

　　“every one says i’m awfully pneumatic，” said lenina reflectively， patting her own legs.

　　“awfully.” but there was an expression of pain in bernard’s eyes. “like meat，” he was thinking.

　　she looked up with a certain anxiety. “but you don’t think i’m too plump， do you？”

　　he shook his head. like so much meat.

　　“you think i’m all right.” another nod. “in every way？”

　　“perfect，” he said aloud. and inwardly. “she thinks of herself that way. she doesn’t mind being meat.”

　　lenina smiled triumphantly. but her satisfaction was premature.

　　“all the same，” he went on， after a little pause， “i still rather wish it had all ended differently.”

　　“differently？” were there other endings？

　　“i didn’t want it to end with our going to bed，” he specified.

　　lenina was astonished.

　　“not at once， not the first day.”

　　“but then what…？”

　　he began to talk a lot of incomprehensible and dangerous nonsense. lenina did her best to stop the ears of her mind； but every now and then a phrase would insist on becoming audible. “…to try the effect of arresting my impulses，” she heard him say. the words seemed to touch a spring in her mind.

　　“never put off till to-morrow the fun you can have to-day，” she said gravely.

　　“two hundred repetitions， twice a week from fourteen to sixteen and a half，” was all his comment. the mad bad talk rambled on. “i want to know what passion is，” she heard him saying. “i want to feel something strongly.”

　　“when the individual feels， the community reels，” lenina pronounced.

　　“well， why shouldn’t it reel a bit？”

　　“bernard！”

　　but bernard remained unabashed.

　　“adults intellectually and during working hours，” he went on. “infants where feeling and desire are concerned.”

　　“our ford loved infants.”

　　ignoring the interruption. “it suddenly struck me the other day，” continued bernard， “that it might be possible to be an adult all the time.”

　　“i don’t understand.” lenina’s tone was firm.

　　“i know you don’t. and that’s why we went to bed together yesterday–like infants–instead of being adults and waiting.”

　　“but it was fun，” lenina insisted. “wasn’t it？”

　　“oh， the greatest fun，” he answered， but in a voice so mournful， with an expression so profoundly miserable， that lenina felt all her triumph suddenly evaporate. perhaps he had found her too plump， after all.

　　“i told you so，” was all that fanny said， when lenina came and made her confidences. “it’s the alcohol they put in his surrogate.”

　　“all the same，” lenina insisted. “i do like him. he has such awfully nice hands. and the way he moves his shoulders–that’s very attractive.” she sighed. “but i wish he weren’t so odd.”

　　halting for a moment outside the door of the director’s room， bernard drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders， bracing himself to meet the dislike and disapproval which he was certain of finding within. he knocked and entered.

　　“a permit for you to initial， director，” he said as airily as possible， and laid the paper on the writing-table.

　　the director glanced at him sourly. but the stamp of the world controller’s office was at the head of the paper and the signature of mustapha mond， bold and black， across the bottom. everything was perfectly in order. the director had no choice. he pencilled his initials–two small pale letters abject at the feet of mustapha mond–and was about to return the paper without a word of comment or genial ford-speed， when his eye was caught by something written in the body of the permit.

　　“for the new mexican reservation？” he said， and his tone， the face he lifted to bernard， expressed a kind of agitated astonishment.

　　surprised by his surprise， bernard nodded. there was a silence.

　　the director leaned back in his chair， frowning. “how long ago was it？” he said， speaking more to himself than to bernard. “twenty years， i suppose. nearer twenty-five. i must have been your age…” he sighed and shook his head.

第54章 Chapter Six(3)


　　bernard felt extremely uncomfortable. a man so conventional， so scrupulously correct as the director–and to commit so gross a solecism！ lt made him want to hide his face， to run out of the room. not that he himself saw anything intrinsically objectionable in people talking about the remote past； that was one of those hypnopaedic prejudices he had （so he imagined） completely got rid of. what made him feel shy was the knowledge that the director disapproved–disapproved and yet had been betrayed into doing the forbidden thing. under what inward compulsion？ through his discomfort bernard eagerly listened.

　　“i had the same idea as you，” the director was saying. “wanted to have a look at the savages. got a permit for new mexico and went there for my summer holiday. with the girl i was having at the moment. she was a beta-minus， and i think” （he shut his eyes）， “i think she had yellow hair. anyhow she was pneumatic， particularly pneumatic； i remember that. well， we went there， and we looked at the savages， and we rode about on horses and all that. and then–it was almost the last day of my leave–then…well， she got lost. we’d gone riding up one of those revolting mountains， and it was horribly hot and oppressive， and after lunch we went to sleep. or at least i did. she must have gone for a walk， alone. at any rate， when i woke up， she wasn’t there. and the most frightful thunderstorm i’ve ever seen was just bursting on us. and it poured and roared and flashed； and the horses broke loose and ran away； and i fell down， trying to catch them， and hurt my knee， so that i could hardly walk. still， i searched and i shouted and i searched. but there was no sign of her. then i thought she must have gone back to the rest-house by herself. so i crawled down into the valley by the way we had come. my knee was agonizingly painful， and i’d lost my soma. it took me hours. i didn’t get back to the rest-house till after midnight. and she wasn’t there； she wasn’t there，” the director repeated. there was a silence. “well，” he resumed at last， “the next day there was a search. but we couldn’t find her. she must have fallen into a gully somewhere； or been eaten by a mountain lion. ford knows. anyhow it was horrible. it upset me very much at the time. more than it ought to have done， i dare say. because， after all， it’s the sort of accident that might have happened to any one； and， of course， the social body persists although the component cells may change.” but this sleep-taught consolation did not seem to be very effective. shaking his head， “i actually dream about it sometimes，” the director went on in a low voice. “dream of being woken up by that peal of thunder and finding her gone； dream of searching and searching for her under the trees.” he lapsed into the silence of reminiscence.

　　“you must have had a terrible shock，” said bernard， almost enviously.

　　at the sound of his voice the director started into a guilty realization of where he was； shot a glance at bernard， and averting his eyes， blushed darkly； looked at him again with sudden suspicion and， angrily on his dignity， “don’t imagine，” he said， “that i’d had any indecorous relation with the girl. nothing emotional， nothing long-drawn. it was all perfectly healthy and normal.” he handed bernard the permit. “i really don’t know why i bored you with this trivial anecdote.” furious with himself for having given away a discreditable secret， he vented his rage on bernard. the look in his eyes was now frankly malignant. “and i should like to take this opportunity， mr. marx，” he went on， “of saying that i’m not at all pleased with the reports i receive of your behaviour outside working hours. you may say that this is not my business. but it is. i have the good name of the centre to think of. my workers must be above suspicion， particularly those of the highest castes. alphas are so conditioned that they do not have to be infantile in their emotional behaviour. but that is all the more reason for their making a special effort to conform. lt is their duty to be infantile， even against their inclination. and so， mr. marx， i give you fair warning.” the director’s voice vibrated with an indignation that had now become wholly righteous and impersonal–was the expression of the disapproval of society itself. “if ever i hear again of any lapse from a proper standard of infantile decorum， i shall ask for your transference to a sub-centre–preferably to iceland. good morning.” and swivelling round in his chair， he picked up his pen and began to write.

　　“that’ll teach him，” he said to himself. but he was mistaken. for bernard left the room with a swagger， exulting， as he banged the door behind him， in the thought that he stood alone， embattled against the order of things； elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individual significance and importance. even the thought of persecution left him undismayed， was rather tonic than depressing. he felt strong enough to meet and overcome amiction， strong enough to face even iceland. and this confidence was the greater for his not for a moment really believing that he would be called upon to face anything at all. people simply weren’t transferred for things like that. iceland was just a threat. a most stimulating and life-giving threat. walking along the corridor， he actually whistled.

　　heroic was the account he gave that evening of his interview with the d.h.c. “whereupon，” he concluded， “i simply told him to go to the bottomless past and marched out of the room. and that was that.” he looked at helmholtz watson expectantly， awaiting his due reward of sympathy， encouragement， admiration. but no word came. helmholtz sat silent， staring at the floor.

　　he liked bernard； he was grateful to him for being the only man of his acquaintance with whom he could talk about the subjects he felt to be important. nevertheless， there were things in bernard which he hated. this boasting， for example. and the

　　outbursts of an abject self-pity with which it alternated. and his deplorable habit of being bold after the event， and full， in absence， of the most extraordinary presence of mind. he hated these things–just because he liked bernard. the seconds passed. helmholtz continued to stare at the floor. and suddenly bernard blushed and turned away.

第55章 Chapter Six(4)


　　the journey was quite uneventful. the blue pacific rocket was two and a half minutes early at new orleans， lost four minutes in a tornado over texas， but flew into a favourable air current at longitude 95 west， and was able to land at santa fé less than forty seconds behind schedule time.

　　“forty seconds on a six and a half hour flight. not so bad，” lenina conceded.

　　they slept that night at santa fé. the hotel was excellent–incomparably better， for example， than that horrible aurora bora palace in which lenina had suffered so much the previous summer. liquid air， television， vibro-vacuum massage， radio， boiling caffeine solution， hot contraceptives， and eight different kinds of scent were laid on in every bedroom. the synthetic music plant was working as they entered the hall and left nothing to be desired. a notice in the lift announced that there were sixty escalator-squash-racket courts in the hotel， and that obstacle and electro-magnetic golf could both be played in the park.

　　“but it sounds simply too lovely，” cried lenina. “i almost wish we could stay here. sixty escalator-squash courts…”

　　“there won’t be any in the reservation，” bernard warned her. “and no scent， no television， no hot water even. if you feel you can’t stand it， stay here till i come back.”

　　lenina was quite offended. “of course i can stand it. i only said it was lovely here because…well， because progress is lovely， isn’t it？”

　　“five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen，” said bernard wearily， as though to himself.

　　“what did you say？”

　　“i said that progress was lovely. that’s why you mustn’t come to the reservation unless you really want to.”

　　“but i do want to.”

　　“very well， then，” said bernard； and it was almost a threat.

　　their permit required the signature of the warden of the reservation， at whose office next morning they duly presented themselves. an epsilon-plus negro porter took in bernard’s card， and they were admitted almost immediately.

　　the warden was a blond and brachycephalic alpha-minus， short， red， moon-faced， and broad-shouldered， with a loud booming voice， very well adapted to the utterance of hypnop？dic wisdom. he was a mine of irrelevant information and unasked-for good advice. once started， he went on and on–boomingly.

　　“…five hundred and sixty thousand square kilometres， divided into four distinct sub-reservations， each surrounded by a high-tension wire fence.”

　　at this moment， and for no apparent reason， bernard suddenly remembered that he had left the eau de cologne tap in his bathroom wide open and running.

　　“…supplied with current from the grand canyon hydro-electric station.”

　　“cost me a fortune by the time i get back.” with his mind’s eye， bernard saw the needle on the scent meter creeping round and round， antlike， indefatigable. “quickly telephone to helmholtz watson.”

　　“…upwards of five thousand kilometres of fencing at sixty thousand volts.”

　　“you don’t say so，” said lenina politely， not knowing in the least what the warden had said， but taking her cue from his dramatic pause. when the warden started booming， she had inconspicuously swallowed half a gramme of soma， with the result that she could now sit， serenely not listening， thinking of nothing at all， but with her large blue eyes fixed on the warden’s face in an expression of rapt attention.

　　“to touch the fence is instant death，” pronounced the warden solemnly. “there is no escape from a savage reservation.”

　　the word “escape” was suggestive. “perhaps，” said bernard， half rising， “we ought to think of going.” the little black needle was scurrying， an insect， nibbling through time， eating into his money.

　　“no escape，” repeated the warden， waving him back into his chair； and as the permit was not yet countersigned bernard had no choice but to obey. “those who are born in the reservation–and remember， my dear young lady，” he added， leering obscenely at lenina， and speaking in an improper whisper， “remember that， in the reservation， children still are born， yes， actually born， revolting as that may seem…” （he hoped that this reference to a shameful subject would make lenina blush； but she only smiled with simulated intelligence and said， “you don’t say so！” disappointed， the warden began again. ） “those， i repeat who are born in the reservation are destined to die there.”

　　destined to die…a decilitre of eau de cologne every minute. six litres an hour. “perhaps，” bernard tried again， “we ought…”

　　leaning forward， the warden tapped the table with his forefinger. “you ask me how many people live in the reservation. and i reply”–triumphantly–“i reply that we do not know. we can only guess.”

　　“you don’t say so.”

　　“my dear young lady， i do say so.”

　　six times twenty-four–no， it would be nearer six times thirty-six. bernard was pale and trembling with impatience. but inexorably the booming continued.

第56章 Chapter Six(5)


　　“…about sixty thousand indians and half-breeds…absolute savages…our inspectors occasionally visit…otherwise， no communication whatever with the civilized world…still preserve their repulsive habits and customs…marriage， if you know what that is， my dear young lady； families…no conditioning…monstrous superstitions…christianity and totemism and ancestor worship…extinct languages， such as zu？i and spanish and athapascan…pumas， porcupines and other ferocious animals…infectious diseases…priests…venomous lizards…”

　　“you don’t say so？”

　　they got away at last. bernard dashed to the telephone. quick， quick； but it took him nearly three minutes to get on to helmholtz watson. “we might be among the savages already，” he complained. “damned incompetence！”

　　“have a gramme，” suggested lenina.

　　he refused， preferring his anger. and at last， thank ford， he was through and， yes， it was helmholtz； helmholtz， to whom he explained what had happened， and who promised to go round at once， at once， and turn off the tap， yes， at once， but took this opportunity to tell him what the d.h.c. had said， in public， yesterday evening…

　　“what？ he’s looking out for some one to take my place？” bernard’s voice was agonized. “so it’s actually decided？ did he mention iceland？ you say he did？ ford！ iceland…” he hung up the receiver and turned back to lenina. his face was pale， his expression utterly dejected.

　　“what’s the matter？” she asked.

　　“the matter？” he dropped heavily into a chair. “i’m going to be sent to iceland.”

　　often in the past he had wondered what it would be like to be subjected （soma-less and with nothing but his own inward resources to rely on） to some great trial， some pain， some persecution； he had even longed for affliction. as recently as a week ago， in the director’s office， he had imagined himself courageously resisting， stoically accepting suffering without a word. the director’s threats had actually elated him， made him feel larger than life. but that， as he now realized， was because he had not taken the threats quite seriously， he had not believed that， when it came to the point， the d.h.c. would ever do anything. now that it looked as though the threats were really to be fulfilled， bernard was appalled. of that imagined stoicism， that theoretical courage， not a trace was left.

　　he raged against himself–what a fool！–against the director–how unfair not to give him that other chance， that other chance which， he now had no doubt at all， he had always intended to take. and iceland， iceland…

　　lenina shook her head. “was and will make me ill，” she quoted， “i take a gramme and only am.”

　　in the end she persuaded him to swallow four tablets of soma. five minutes later roots and fruits were abolished； the flower of the present rosily blossomed. a message from the porter announced that， at the warden’s orders， a reservation guard had come round with a plane and was waiting on the roof of the hotel. they went up at once. an octoroon in gamma-green uniform saluted and proceeded to recite the morning’s programme.

　　a bird’s-eye view of ten or a dozen of the principal pueblos， then a landing for lunch in the valley of malpais. the rest-house was comfortable there， and up at the pueblo the savages would probably be celebrating their summer festival. it would be the best place to spend the night.

　　they took their seats in the plane and set off. ten minutes later they were crossing the frontier that separated civilization from savagery. uphill and down， across the deserts of salt or sand， through forests， into the violet depth of canyons， over crag and peak and table-topped mesa， the fence marched on and on， irresistibly the straight line， the geometrical symbol of triumphant human purpose. and at its foot， here and there， a mosaic of white bones， a still unrotted carcase dark on the tawny ground marked the place where deer or steer， puma or porcupine or coyote， or the greedy turkey buzzards drawn down by the whiff of carrion and fulminated as though by a poetic justice， had come too close to the destroying wires.

　　“they never learn，” said the green-uniformed pilot， pointing down at the skeletons on the ground below them. “and they never will learn，” he added and laughed， as though he had somehow scored a personal triumph over the electrocuted animals.

　　bernard also laughed； after two grammes of soma the joke seemed， for some reason， good. laughed and then， almost immediately， dropped off to sleep， and sleeping was carried over taos and tesuque； over nambe and picuris and pojoaque， over sia and cochiti， over laguna and acoma and the enchanted mesa， over zu？i and cibola and ojo caliente， and woke at last to find the machine standing on the ground， lenina carrying the suit-cases into a small square house， and the gamma-green octoroon talking incomprehensibly with a young indian.

　　“malpais，” explained the pilot， as bernard stepped out. “this is the rest-house. and there’s a dance this afternoon at the pueblo. he’ll take you there.” he pointed to the sullen young savage. “funny， i expect.” he grinned. “everything they do is funny.” and with that he climbed into the plane and started up the engines. “back to-morrow. and remember，” he added reassuringly to lenina， “they’re perfectly tame； savages won’t do you any harm. they’ve got enough experience of gas bombs to know that they mustn’t play any tricks.” still laughing， he threw the helicopter screws into gear， accelerated， and was gone.

第57章 Chapter Seven(1)


　　the mesa was like a ship becalmed in a strait of lion-coloured dust. the channel wound between precipitous banks， and slanting from one wall to the other across the valley ran a streak of green-the river and its fields. on the prow of that stone ship in the centre of the strait， and seemingly a part of it， a shaped and geometrical outcrop of the naked rock， stood the pueblo of malpais. block above block， each story smaller than the one below， the tall houses rose like stepped and amputated pyramids into the blue sky. at their feet lay a straggle of low buildings， a criss-cross of walls； and on three sides the precipices fell sheer into the plain. a few columns of smoke mounted perpendicularly into the windless air and were lost.

　　“queer，” said lenina. “very queer.” it was her ordinary word of condemnation. “i don’t like it. and i don’t like that man.” she pointed to the indian guide who had been appointed to take them up to the pueblo. her feeling was evidently reciprocated； the very back of the man， as he walked along before them， was hostile， sullenly contemptuous.

　　“besides，” she lowered her voice， “he smells.”

　　bernard did not attempt to deny it. they walked on.

　　suddenly it was as though the whole air had come alive and were pulsing， pulsing with the indefatigable movement of blood. up there， in malpais， the drums were being beaten. their feet fell in with the rhythm of that mysterious heart； they quickened their pace. their path led them to the foot of the precipice. the sides of the great mesa ship towered over them， three hundred feet to the gunwale.

　　“i wish we could have brought the plane，” said lenina， looking up resentfully at the blank impending rock-face. “i hate walking. and you feel so small when you’re on the ground at the bottom of a hill.”

　　they walked along for some way in the shadow of the mesa， rounded a projection， and there， in a water-worn ravine， was the way up the companion ladder. they climbed. it was a very steep path that zigzagged from side to side of the gully. sometimes the pulsing of the drums was all but inaudible， at others they seemed to be beating only just round the corner.

　　when they were half-way up， an eagle flew past so close to them that the wind of his wings blew chill on their faces. in a crevice of the rock lay a pile of bones. it was all oppressively queer， and the indian smelt stronger and stronger. they emerged at last from the ravine into the full sunlight. the top of the mesa was a flat deck of stone.

　　“like the charing-t tower，” was lenina’s comment. but she was not allowed to enjoy her discovery of this reassuring resemblance for long. a padding of soft feet made them turn round. naked from throat to navel， their dark brown bodies painted with white lines （“like asphalt tennis courts，” lenina was later to explain）， their faces inhuman with daubings of scarlet， black and ochre， two indians came running along the path. their black hair was braided with fox fur and red flannel. cloaks of turkey feathers fluttered from their shoulders； huge feather diadems exploded gaudily round their heads. with every step they took came the clink and rattle of their silver bracelets， their heavy necklaces of bone and turquoise beads. they came on without a word， running quietly in their deerskin moccasins. one of them was holding a feather brush； the other carried， in either hand， what looked at a distance like three or four pieces of thick rope. one of the ropes writhed uneasily， and suddenly lenina saw that they were snakes.

　　the men came nearer and nearer； their dark eyes looked at her， but without giving any sign of recognition， any smallest sign that they had seen her or were aware of her existence. the writhing snake hung limp again with the rest. the men passed.

　　“i don’t like it，” said lenina. “i don’t like it.”

　　she liked even less what awaited her at the entrance to the pueblo， where their guide had left them while he went inside for instructions. the dirt， to start with， the piles of rubbish， the dust， the dogs， the flies. her face wrinkled up into a grimace of disgust. she held her handkerchief to her nose.

　　“but how can they live like this？” she broke out in a voice of indignant incredulity. （it wasn’t possible.）

　　bernard shrugged his shoulders philosophically. “anyhow，” he said， “they’ve been doing it for the last five or six thousand years. so i suppose they must be used to it by now.”

　　“but cleanliness is next to fordliness，” she insisted.

　　“yes， and civilization is sterilization，” bernard went on， concluding on a tone of irony the second hypnop？dic lesson in elementary hygiene. “but these people have never heard of our ford， and they aren’t civilized. so there’s no point in…”

　　“oh！” she gripped his arm. “look.”

　　an almost naked indian was very slowly climbing down the ladder from the first-floor terrace of a neighboring house–rung after rung， with the tremulous caution of extreme old age. his face was profoundly wrinkled and black， like a mask of obsidian. the toothless mouth had fallen in. at the corners of the lips， and on each side of the chin， a few long bristles gleamed almost white against the dark skin. the long unbraided hair hung down in grey wisps round his face. his body was bent and emaciated to the bone， almost fleshless. very slowly he came down， pausing at each rung before he ventured another step.

　　“what’s the matter with him？” whispered lenina. her eyes were wide with horror and amazement.

　　“he’s old， that’s all，” bernard answered as carelessly as he could. he too was startled； but he made an effort to seem unmoved.

　　“old？” she repeated. “but the director’s old； lots of people are old； they’re not like that.”

　　“that’s because we don’t allow them to be like that. we preserve them from diseases. we keep their internal secretions artificially balanced at a youthful equilibrium. we don’t permit their magnesium-calcium ratio to fall below what it was at thirty. we give them transfusion of young blood. we keep their metabolism permanently stimulated. so， of course， they don’t look like that. partly，” he added， “because most of them die long before they reach this old creature’s age. youth almost unimpaired till sixty， and then， crack！ the end.”

第58章 Chapter Seven(2)


　　but lenina was not listening. she was watching the old man. slowly， slowly he came down. his feet touched the ground. he turned. in their deep-sunken orbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright. they looked at her for a long moment expressionlessly， without surprise， as though she had not been there at all. then slowly， with bent back the old man hobbled past them and was gone.

　　“but it’s terrible，” lenina whispered. “it’s awful. we ought not to have come here.” she felt in her pocket for her soma–only to discover that， by some unprecedented oversight， she had left the bottle down at the rest-house. bernard’s pockets were also empty.

　　lenina was left to face the horrors of malpais unaided. they came crowding in on her thick and fast. the spectacle of two young women giving breast to their babies made her blush and turn away her face. she had never seen anything so indecent in her life. and what made it worse was that， instead of tactfully ignoring it， bernard proceeded to make open comments on this revoltingly viviparous scene. ashamed， now that the effects of the soma had worn off， of the weakness he had displayed that morning in the hotel， he went out of his way to show himself strong and unorthodox.

　　“what a wonderfully intimate relationship，” he said， deliberately outrageous. “and what an intensity of feeling it must generate！ i often think one may have missed something in not having had a mother. and perhaps you’ve missed something in not being a mother， lenina. imagine yourself sitting there with a little baby of your own.…”

　　“bernard！ how can you？” the passage of an old woman with ophthalmia and a disease of the skin distracted her from her indignation.

　　“let’s go away，” she begged. “i don’t like it.”

　　but at this moment their guide came back and， beckoning them to follow， led the way down the narrow street between the houses. they rounded a corner. a dead dog was lying on a rubbish heap； a woman with a goitre was looking for lice in the hair of a small girl. their guide halted at the foot of a ladder， raised his hand perpendicularly， then darted it horizontally forward. they did what he mutely commanded–climbed the ladder and walked through the doorway， to which it gave access， into a long narrow room， rather dark and smelling of smoke and cooked grease and long-worn， long-unwashed clothes. at the further end of the room was another doorway， through which came a shaft of surdight and the noise， very loud and close， of the drums.

　　they stepped across the threshold and found themselves on a wide terrace. below them， shut in by the tall houses， was the village square， crowded with indians. bright blankets， and feathers in black hair， and the glint of turquoise， and dark skins shining with heat. lenina put her handkerchief to her nose again. in the open space at the centre of the square were two circular platforms of masonry and trampled clay–the roofs， it was evident， of underground chambers； for in the centre of each platform was an open hatchway， with a ladder emerging from the lower darkness. a sound of subterranean flute playing came up and was almost lost in the steady remorseless persistence of the drums.

　　lenina liked the drums. shutting her eyes she abandoned herself to their soft repeated thunder， allowed it to invade her consciousness more and more completely， till at last there was nothing left in the world but that one deep pulse of sound. it reminded her reassuringly of the synthetic noises made at solidarity services and ford’s day celebrations. “orgy-porgy，” she whispered to herself. these drums beat out just the same rhythms.

　　there was a sudden startling burst of singing–hundreds of male voices crying out fiercely in harsh metallic unison. a few long notes and silence， the thunderous silence of the drums； then shrill， in a neighing treble， the women’s answer. then again the drums； and once more the men’s deep savage affirmation of their manhood.

　　queer–yes. the place was queer， so was the music， so were the clothes and the goitres and the skin diseases and the old people. but the performance itself–there seemed to be nothing specially queer about that.

　　“it reminds me of a lower-caste community sing，” she told bernard.

第59章 Chapter Seven(3)


　　but a little later it was reminding her a good deal less of that innocuous function. for suddenly there had swarmed up from those round chambers unterground a ghastly troop of monsters. hideously masked or painted out of all semblance of humanity， they had tramped out a strange limping dance round the square； round and again round， singing as they went， round and round–each time a little faster； and the drums had changed and quickened their rhythm， so that it became like the pulsing of fever in the ears； and the crowd had begun to sing with the dancers， louder and louder； and first one woman had shrieked， and then another and another， as though they were being killed； and then suddenly the leader of the dancers broke out of the line， ran to a big wooden chest which was standing at one end of the square， raised the lid and pulled out a pair of black snakes. a great yell went up from the crowd， and all the other dancers ran towards him with out-stretched hands. he tossed the snakes to the first-comers， then dipped back into the chest for more. more and more， black snakes and brown and mottled-he flung them out. and then the dance began again on a different rhythm. round and round they went with their snakes， snakily， with a soft undulating movement at the knees and hips. round and round. then the leader gave a signal， and one after another， all the snakes were flung down in the middle of the square； an old man came up from underground and sprinkled them with corn meal， and from the other hatchway came a woman and sprinkled them with water from a black jar. then the old man lifted his hand and， startingly， terrifyingly， there was absolute silence. the drums stopped beating， life seemed to have come to an end. the old man pointed towards the two hatchways that gave entrance to the lower world. and slowly， raised by invisible hands from below， there emerged from the one a painted image of an eagle， from the other that of a man， naked， and nailed to a cross. they hung there， seemingly self-sustained， as though watching. the old man clapped his hands. naked but for a white cotton breech-cloth， a boy of about eighteen stepped out of the crowd and stood before him， his hands crossed over his chest， his head bowed. the old man made the sign of the cross over him and turned away. slowly， the boy began to walk round the writhing heap of snakes. he had completed the first circuit and was half-way through the second when， from among the dancers， a tall man wearing the mask of a coyote and holding in his hand a whip of plaited leather， advanced towards him. the boy moved on as though unaware of the other’s existence. the coyote-man raised his whip， there was a long moment af expectancy， then a swift movement， the whistle of the lash and its loud flat-sounding impact on the ftesh. the boy’s body quivered； but he made no sound， he walked on at the same slow， steady pace. the coyote struck again， again； and at every blow at first a gasp， and then a deep groan went up from the crowd. the boy walked. twice， thrice， four times round he went. the blood was streaming. five times round， six times round. suddenly lenina covered her face with her hands and began to sob. “oh， stop them， stop them！” she implored. but the whip fell and fell inexorably. seven times round. then all at once the boy staggered and， still without a sound， pitched forward on to his face. bending over him， the old man touched his back with a long white feather， held it up for a moment， crimson， for the people to see then shook it thrice over the snakes. a few drops fell， and suddenly the drums broke out again into a panic of hurrying notes； there was a great shout. the dancers rushed forward， picked up the snakes and ran out of the square. men， women， children， all the crowd ran after them. a minute later the square was empty， only the boy remained， prone where he had fallen， quite still. three old women came out of one of the houses， and with some difficulty lifted him and carried him in. the eagle and the man on the cross kept guard for a little while over the empty pueblo； then， as though they had seen enough， sank slowly down through their hatchways， out of sight， into the nether world.

　　lenina was still sobbing. “too awful，” she kept repeating， and all bernard’s consolations were in vain. “too awful！ that blood！” she shuddered. “oh， i wish i had my soma.”

　　there was the sound of feet in the inner room.

　　lenina did not move， but sat with her face in her hands， unseeing， apart. only bernard turned round.

　　the dress of the young man who now stepped out on to the terrace was indian； but his plaited hair was straw-coloured， his eyes a pale blue， and his skin a white skin， bronzed.

　　“hullo. good-morrow，” said the stranger， in faultless but peculiar english. “you’re civilized， aren’t you？ you come from the other place， outside the reservation？”

　　“who on earth…？” bernard began in astonishment.

　　the young man sighed and shook his head. “a most unhappy gentleman.” and， pointing to the bloodstains in the centre of the square， “do you see that damned spot？” he asked in a voice that trembled with emotion.

　　“a gramme is better than a damn，” said lenina mechanically from behind her hands. “i wish i had my soma！”

　　“i ought to have been there，” the young man went on. “why wouldn’t they let me be the sacrifice？ i’d have gone round ten times–twelve， fifteen. palowhtiwa only got as far as seven. they could have had twice as much blood from me. the multitudinous seas incarnadine.” he flung out his arms in a lavish gesture； then， despairingly， let them fall again. “but they wouldn’t let me. they disliked me for my complexion. it’s always been like that. always.” tears stood in the young man’s eyes； he was ashamed and turned away.

　　astonishment made lenina forget the deprivation of soma. she uncovered her face and， for the first time， looked at the stranger. “do you mean to say that you wanted to be hit with that whip？”

第60章 Chapter Seven(4)


　　still averted from her， the young man made a sign of affirmation. “for the sake of the pueblo–to make the rain come and the corn grow. and to please pookong and jesus. and then to show that i can bear pain without crying out. yes，” and his voice suddenly took on a new resonance， he turned with a proud squaring of the shoulders， a proud， defiant lifting of the chin “to show that i’m a man…oh！” he gave a gasp and was silent， gaping. he had seen， for the first time in his life， the face of a girl whose cheeks were not the colour of chocolate or dogskin， whose hair was auburn and permanently waved， and whose expression （amazing novelty！） was one of benevolent interest. lenina was smiling at him； such a nice-looking boy， she was thinking， and a really beautiful body. the blood rushed up into the young man’s face； he dropped his eyes， raised them again for a moment only to find her still smiling at him， and was so much overcome that he had to turn away and pretend to be looking very hard at something on the other side of the square.

　　bernard’s questions made a diversion. who？ how？ when？ from where？ keeping his eyes fixed on bernard’s face （for so passionately did he long to see lenina smiling that he simply dared not look at her）， the young man tried to explain himself. linda and he–linda was his mother （the word made lenina look uncomfortable）–were strangers in the reservation. linda had come from the other place long ago， before he was born， with a man who was his father. （bernard pricked up his ears.） she had gone walking alone in those mountains over there to the north， had fallen down a steep place and hurt her head. （“go on， go on，” said bernard excitedly.） some hunters from malpais had found her and brought her to the pueblo. as for the man who was his father， linda had never seen him again. his name was tomakin. （yes， “thomas” was the d.h.c.’s first name.） he must have flown away， back to the other place， away without her–a bad， unkind， unnatural man.

　　“and so i was born in malpais，” he concluded. “in malpais.” and he shook his head.

　　the squalor of that little house on the outskirts of the pueblo！

　　a space of dust and rubbish separated it from the village. two famine-stricken dogs were nosing obscenely in the garbage at its door. inside， when they entered， the twilight stank and was loud with flies.

　　“linda！” the young man called.

　　from the inner room a rather hoarse female voice said， “coming.”

　　they waited. in bowls on the floor were the remains of a meal， perhaps of several meals.

　　the door opened. a very stout blonde squaw stepped across the threshold and stood looking at the strangers staring incredulously， her mouth open. lenina noticed with disgust that two of the front teeth were missing. and the colour of the ones that remained…she shuddered. it was worse than the old man. so fat. and all the lines in her face， the flabbiness， the wrinkles. and the sagging cheeks， with those purplish blotches. and the red veins on her nose， the bloodshot eyes. and that neck–that neck； and the blanket she wore over her head–ragged and filthy.

　　and under the brown sack-shaped tunic those enormous breasts， the bulge of the stomach， the hips. oh， much worse than the old man， much worse！ and suddenly the creature burst out in a torrent of speech， rushed at her with outstretched arms and–ford！ ford！ it was too revolting， in another moment she’d be sick–pressed her against the bulge， the bosom， and began to kiss her. ford！ to kiss， slobberingly， and smelt too horrible， obviously never had a bath， and simply reeked of that beastly stuff that was put into delta and epsilon bottles （no， it wasn’t true about bernard）， positively stank of alcohol. she broke away as quickly as she could.

　　a blubbered and distorted face confronted her； the creature was crying.

第61章 Chapter Seven(5)


　　“oh， my dear， my dear.” the torrent of words flowed sobbingly. “if you knew how glad–after all these years！ a civilized face. yes， and civilized clothes. because i thought i should never see a piece of real acetate silk again.” she fingered the sleeve of lenina’s shirt. the nails were black. “and those adorable viscose velveteen shorts！ do you know， dear， i’ve still got my old clothes， the ones i came in， put away in a box. i’ll show them you afterwards. though， of course， the acetate has all gone into holes. but such a lovely white bandolier–though i must say your green morocco is even lovelier. not that it did me much good， that bandolier.” her tears began to flow again. “i suppose john told you. what i had to suffer–and not a gramme of soma to be had. only a drink of mescal every now and then， when popé used to bring it. popé is a boy i used to know. but it makes you feel so bad afterwards. the mescal does， and you’re sick with the peyotl； besides it always made that awful feeling of being ashamed much worse the next day. and i was so ashamed. just think of it： me， a beta–having a baby： put yourself in my place.” （the mere suggestion made lenina shudder.） “though it wasn’t my fault， i swear； because i still don’t know how it happened， seeing that i did all the malthusian drill–you know， by numbers， one， two， three， four， always， i swear it； but all the same it happened， and of course there wasn’t anything like an abortion centre here. is it still down in chelsea， by the way？” she asked. lenina nodded. “and still floodlighted on tuesdays and fridays？” lenina nodded again. “that lovely pink glass tower！” poor linda lifted her face and with closed eyes ecstatically contemplated the bright remembered image. “and the river at night，” she whispered. great tears oozed slowly out from behind her tight-shut eyelids. “and flying back in the evening from stoke poges. and then a hot bath and vibro-vacuum massage…but there.” she drew a deep breath， shook her head， opened her eyes again， sniffed once or twice， then blew her nose on her fingers and wiped them on the skirt of her tunic. “oh， i’m so sorry，” she said in response to lenina’s involuntary grimace of disgust. “i oughtn’t to have done that. i’m sorry. but what are you to do when there aren’t any handkerchiefs？ i remember how it used to upset me， all that dirt， and nothing being aseptic. i had an awful cut on my head when they first brought me here. you can’t imagine what they used to put on it. filth， just filth. ‘civilization is sterilization，’ i used to say them. and ‘streptocock-gee to banbury-t， to see a fine bathroom and w.c.’ as though they were children. but of course they didn’t understand. how should they？ and in the end i suppose i got used to it. and anyhow， how can you keep things clean when there isn’t hot water laid on？ and look at these clothes. this beastly wool isn’t like acetate. it lasts and lasts. and you’re supposed to mend it if it gets torn. but i’m a beta； i worked in the fertilizing room； nobody ever taught me to do anything like that. it wasn’t my business. besides， it never used to be right to mend clothes. throw them away when they’ve got holes in them and buy new. ‘the more stiches， the less riches.’ isn’t that right？ mending’s anti-social. but it’s all different here. it’s like living with lunatics. everything they do is mad.” she looked round； saw john and bernard had left them and were walking up and down in the dust and garbage outside the house； but， none the less confidentially lowering her voice， and leaning， while lenina stiffened and shrank， so close that the blown reek of embryo-poison stirred the hair on her cheek. “for instance，” she hoarsely whispered， “take the way they have one another here. mad， i tell you， absolutely mad. everybody belongs to every one else–don’t they？ don’t they？” she insisted， tugging at lenina’s sleeve. lenina nodded her averted head， let out the breath she had been holding and managed to draw another one， relatively untainted. “well， here，” the other went on， “nobody’s supposed to belong to more than one person. and if you have people in the ordinary way， the others think you’re wicked and anti-social. they hate and despise you. once a lot of women came and made a scene because their men came to see me. well， why not？ and then they rushed at me…no， it was too awful. i can’t tell you about it.” linda covered her face with her hands and shuddered. “they’re so hateful， the women here. mad， mad and cruel. and of course they don’t know anything about malthusian drill， or bottles， or decanting， or anything of that sort. so they’re having children all the time–like dogs. it’s too revolting. and to think that i…oh， ford， ford， ford！ and yet john was a great comfort to me. i don’t know what i should have done without him. even though he did get so upset whenever a man…quite as a tiny boy， even. once （but that was when he was bigger） he tried to kill poor waihusiwa–or was it popé？–just because i used to have them sometimes. because i never could make him understand that that was what civilized people ought to do. being mad’s infectious i believe. anyhow， john seems to have caught it from the indians. because， of course， he was with them a lot. even though they always were so beastly to him and wouldn’t let him do all the things the other boys did. which was a good thing in a way， because it made it easier for me to condition him a little. though you’ve no idea how difficult that is. there’s so much one doesn’t know； it wasn’t my business to know. i mean， when a child asks you how a helicopter works or who made the world–well， what are you to answer if you’re a beta and have always worked in the fertilizing room？ what are you to answer？”

第62章 Chapter Eight(1)


　　outside， in the dust and among the garbage （there were four dogs now）， bernard and john were walking slowly up and down.

　　“so hard for me to realize，” bernard was saying， “to reconstruct. as though we were living on different planets， in different centuries. a mother， and all this dirt， and gods， and old age， and disease…” he shook his head. “it’s almost inconceivable. i shall never understand， unless you explain.”

　　“explain what？”

　　“this.” he indicated the pueblo. “that.” and it was the little house outside the village. “everything. all your life.”

　　“but what is there to say？”

　　“from the beginning. as far back as you can remember.”

　　“as far back as i can remember.” john frowned. there was a long silence.

　　it was very hot. they had eaten a lot of tortillas and sweet corn. linda said， “come and lie down， baby.” they lay down together in the big bed. “sing，” and linda sang. sang “streptocock-gee to banbury-t” and “bye baby banting， soon you’ll need decanting.” her voice got fainter and fainter…

　　there was a loud noise， and he woke with a start. a man was saying something to linda， and linda was laughing. she had pulled the blanket up to her chin， but the man pulled it down again. his hair was like two black ropes， and round his arm was a lovely silver bracelet with blue stones in it. he liked the bracelet； but all the same， he was frightened； he hid his face against linda’s body. linda put her hand on him and he felt safer. in those other words he did not understand so well， she said to the man， “not with john here.” the man looked at him， then again at linda， and said a few words in a soft voice. linda said， “no.” but the man bent over the bed towards him and his face was huge， terrible； the black ropes of hair touched the blanket. “no，” linda said again， and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. “no， no！” but the man took hold of one of his arms， and it hurt. he screamed. the man put up his other hand and lifted him up. linda was still holding him， still saying， “no， no.” the man said something short and angry， and suddenly her hands were gone. “linda， linda.” he kicked and wriggled； but the man carried him across to the door， opened it， put him down on the floor in the middle of the other room， and went away， shutting the door behind hirn. he got up， he ran to the door. standing on tiptoe he could just reach the big wooden latch. he lifted it and pushed； but the door wouldn’t open. “linda，” he shouted. she didn’t answer.

　　he remembered a huge room， rather dark； and there were big wooden things with strings fastened to them， and lots of women standing round them–making blankets， linda said. linda told him to sit in the corner with the other children， while she went and helped the women. he played with the little boys for a long time.

　　suddenly people started talking very loud， and there were the women pushing linda away， and linda was crying. she went to the door and he ran after her. he asked her why they were angry. “because i broke something，” she said. and then she got angry too. “how should i know how to do their beastly weaving？” she said. “beastly savages.” he asked her what savages were. when they got back to their house， popé was waiting at the door， and he came in with them. he had a big gourd full of stuff that looked like water； only it wasn’t water， but something with a bad smell that burnt your mouth and made you cough. linda drank some and popé drank some， and then linda laughed a lot and talked very loud； and then she and popé went into the other room. when popé went away， he went into the room. linda was in bed and so fast asleep that he couldn’t wake her.

　　popé used to come often. he said the stuff in the gourd was called mescal； but linda said it ought to be called soma； only it made you feel ill afterwards. he hated popé. he hated them all–all the men who came to see linda. one afternoon， when he had been playing with the other children–it was cold， he remembered， and there was snow on the mountains–he came back to the house and heard angry voices in the bedroom. they were women’s voices， and they said words he didn’t understand， but he knew they were dreadful words. then suddenly， crash！ something was upset； he heard people moving about quickly， and there was another crash and then a noise like hitting a mule， only not so bony； then linda screamed. “oh， don’t， don’t， don’t！” she said. he ran in. there were three women in dark blankets. linda was on the bed. one of the women was holding her wrists. another was lying across her legs， so that she couldn’t kick. the third was hitting her with a whip. once， twice， three times； and each time linda screamed. crying， he tugged at the fringe of the woman’s blanket. “please， please.” with her free hand she held him away. the whip came down again， and again linda screamed. he caught hold of the woman’s enormous brown hand between his own and bit it with all his might. she cried out， wrenched her hand free， and gave him such a push that he fell down. while he was lying on the ground she hit him three times with the whip. it hurt more than anything he had ever felt–like fire. the whip whistled again， fell. but this time it was linda who screamed.

　　“but why did they want to hurt you， linda？” he asked that night. he was crying， because the red marks of the whip on his back still hurt so terribly. but he was also crying because people were so beastly and unfair， and because he was only a little boy and couldn’t do anything against them. linda was crying too. she was grown up， but she wasn’t big enough to fight against three of them. it wasn’t fair for her either. “why did they want to hurt you， linda？”

　　“i don’t know. how should i know？” it was difficult to hear what she said， because she was lying on her stomach and her face was in the pillow. “they say those men are their men，” she went on； and she did not seem to be talking to him at all； she seemed to be talking with some one inside herself. a long talk which she didn’t understand； and in the end she started crying louder than ever.

　　“oh， don’t cry， linda. don’t cry.”

　　he pressed himself against her. he put his arm round her neck. linda cried out. “oh， be careful. my shoulder！ oh！” and she pushed him away， hard. his head banged against the wall. “little idiot！” she shouted； and then， suddenly， she began to slap him. slap， slap…

　　“linda，” he cried out. “oh， mother， don’t！”

　　“i’m not your mother. i won’t be your mother.”

　　“but， linda…oh！” she slapped him on the cheek.

　　“turned into a savage，” she shouted. “having young ones like an animal…if it hadn’t been for you， i might have gone to the inspector， i might have got away. but not with a baby. that would have been too shameful.”

　　he saw that she was going to hit him again， and lifted his arm to guard his face. “oh， don’t， linda， please don’t.”

　　“little beast！” she pulled down his arm； his face was uncovered.

　　“don’t， linda.” he shut his eyes， expecting the blow.

　　but she didn’t hit him. after a little time， he opened his eyes again and saw that she was looking at him. he tried to smile at her. suddenly she put her arms round him and kissed him again and again.

　　sometimes， for several days， linda didn’t get up at all. she lay in bed and was sad. or else she drank the stuff that popé brought and laughed a great deal and went to sleep. sometimes she was sick. often she forgot to wash him， and there was nothing to eat except cold tortillas. he remembered the first time she found those little animals in his hair， how she screamed and screamed.

　　the happiest times were when she told him ahout the other place. “and you really can go flying， whenever you like？”

　　“whenever you like.” and she would tell him about the lovely music that came out of a box， and all the nice games you could play， and the delicious things to eat and drink， and the light that came when you pressed a little thing in the wall， asd the pictures that you could hear and feel and smell， as well as see， and another box for making nice smells， and the pink and green and blue and silver houses as high as mountains， and everybody happy and no one ever sad or angry， and every one belonging to every one else， and the boxes where you could see and hear what was happening at the other side of the world， and babies in lovely clean bottles–everything so clean， and no nasty smells， no dirt at all–and people never lonely， but living together and being so jolly and happy， like the summer dances here in malpais， but much happier， and the happiness being there every day， every day.…he listened by the hour. and sometimes， when he and the other children were tired with too much playing， one of the old men of the pueblo would talk to them， in those other words， of the great transformer of the world， and of the long fight between right hand and left hand， between wet and dry； of awonawilona， who made a great fog by thinking in the night， and then made the whole world out of the fog； of earth mother and sky father； of ahaiyuta and marsailema， the twins of war and chance； of jesus and pookong； of mary and etsanatlehi， the woman who makes herself young again； of the black stone at laguna and the great eagle and our lady of acoma. strange stories， all the more wonderful to him for being told in the other words and so not fully understood. lying in bed， he would think of heaven and london and our lady of acoma and the rows and rows of babies in clean bottles and jesus flying up and linda flying up and the great director of world hatcheries and awonawilona.

　　lots of men came to see linda. the boys began to point their fingers at him. in the strange other words they said that linda was bad； they called her names he did not understand， but that he knew were bad names. one day they sang a song about her， again and again. he threw stones at them. they threw back； a sharp stone cut his cheek. the blood woudn’t stop； he was covered with blood.

　　linda taught him to read. with a piece of charcoal she drew pictures on the wall–an animal sitting down， a baby inside a bottle； then she wrote letters. the cat is on the mat. the tot is in the pot. he learned quickly and easily. when he knew how to read all the words she wrote on the wall， linda opened her big wooden box and pulled out from under those funny little red trousers she never wore a thin little book. he had often seen it before. “when you’re bigger，” she had said， “you can read it.” well， now he was big enough. he was proud. “i’m afraid you won’t find it very exciting，” she said. “but it’s the only thing i have.” she sighed. “if only you could see the lovely reading machines we used to have in london！” he began reading. the chemical and bacteriological conditioning of the embryo. practical instructions for beta embryo-store workers. it took him a quarter of an hour to read the title alone. he threw the book on the floor. “beastly， beastly book！” he said， and began to cry.

　　the boys still sang their horrible song about linda. sometimes， too， they laughed at him for being so ragged. when he tore his clothes， linda did not know how to mend them. in the other place， she told him， people threw away clothes with holes in them and got new ones. “rags， rags！” the boys used to shout at him. “but i can read，” he said to himself， “and they can’t. they don’t even know what reading is.” it was fairly easy， if he thought hard enough about the reading， to pretend that he didn’t mind when they made fun of him. he asked linda to give him the book again.

　　the more the boys pointed and sang， the harder he read. soon he could read all the words quite well. even the longest. but what did they mean？ he asked linda； but even when she could answer it didn’t seem to make it very clear， and generally she couldn’t answer at all.

　　“what are chemicals？” he would ask.

　　“oh， stuff like magnesium salts， and alcohol for keeping the deltas and epsilons small and backward， and calcium carbonate for bones， and all that sort of thing.”

　　“but how do you make chemicals， linda？ where do they come from？”

　　“well， i don’t know. you get them out of bottles. and when the bottles are empty， you send up to the chemical store for more. it’s the chemical store people who make them， i suppose. or else they send to the factory for them. i don’t know. i never did any chemistry. my job was always with the embryos. it was the same with everything else he asked about. linda never seemed to know. the old men of the pueblo had much more definite answers.

　　“the seed of men and all creatures， the seed of the sun and the seed of earth and the seed of the sky–awonawilona made them all out of the fog of increase. now the world has four wombs； and he laid the seeds in the lowest of the four wombs. and gradually the seeds began to grow…”

第64章 Chapter Eight(3)


　　one day （john calculated later that it must have been soon after his twelfth birthday） he came home and found a book that he had never seen before lying on the floor in the bedroom. it was a thick book and looked very old. the binding had been eaten by mice； some of its pages were loose and crumpled. he picked it up， looked at the title-page： the book was called the complete works of william shakespeare.

　　linda was lying on the bed， sipping that horrible stinking mescal out of a cup. “popé brought it，” she said. her voice was thick and hoarse like somebody else’s voice. “it was lying in one of the chests of the antelope kiva. it’s supposed to have been there for hundreds of years. i expect it’s true， because i looked at it， and it seemed to be full of nonsense. uncivilized. still， it’ll be good enough for you to practice your reading on.” she took a last sip， set the cup down on the floor beside the bed， turned over on her side， hiccoughed once or twice and went to sleep.

　　he opened the book at random.

　　nay， but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed， stew’d in corruption， honeying and making love over the nasty sty…

　　the strange words rolled through his mind； rumbled， like talking thunder； like the drums at the summer dances， if the drums could have spoken； like the men singing the corn song， beautiful， beautiful， so that you cried； like old mitsima saying magic over his feathers and his carved sticks and his bits of bone and stone–kiathla tsilu silokwe silokwe silokwe. kiai silu silu， tsithl–but better than mitsima’s magic， because it meant more， because it talked to him， talked wonderfully and only half-understandably， a terrible beautiful magic， about linda； about linda lying there snoring， with the empty cup on the floor beside the bed； about linda and popé， linda and popé.

　　he hated popé more and more. a man can smile and smile and be a villain. remorseless， treacherous， lecherous， kindless villain. what did the words exactly mean？ he only half knew. but their magic was strong and went on rumbling in his head， and somehow it was as though he had never really hated popé before； never really hated him because he had never been able to say how much he hated him. but now he had these words， these words like drums and singing and magic. these words and the strange， strange story out of which they were taken （he couldn’t make head or tail of it， but it was wonderful， wonderful all the same）–they gave him a reason for hating popé； and they made his hatred more real； they even made popé himself more real.

　　one day， when he came in from playing， the door of the inner room was open， and he saw them lying together on the bed， asleep–white linda and popé almost black beside her， with one arm under her shoulders and the other dark hand on her breast， and one of the plaits of his long hair lying across her throat， like a black snake trying to strangle her. popé’s gourd and a cup were standing on the floor near the bed. linda was snoring.

　　his heart seemed to have disappeared and left a hole. he was empty. empty， and cold， and rather sick， and giddy. he leaned against the wall to steady himself. remorseless， treacherous， lecherous…like drums， like the men singing for the corn， like magic， the words repeated and repeated themselves in his head. from being cold he was suddenly hot. his cheeks burnt with the rush of blood， the room swam and darkened before his eyes. he ground his teeth. “i’ll kill him， i’ll kill him， i’ll kill him，” he kept saying. and suddenly there were more words.

　　when he is drunk asleep， or in his rage or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed…

　　the magic was on his side， the magic explained and gave orders. he stepped back in the outer room. “when he is drunk asleep…” the knife for the meat was lying on the floor near the fireplace. he picked it up and tiptoed to the door again. “when he is drunk asleep， drunk asleep…” he ran across the room and stabbed–oh， the blood！–stabbed again， as popé heaved out of his sleep， lifted his hand to stab once more， but found his wrist caught， held and–oh， oh！–twisted. he couldn’t move， he was trapped， and there were popé’s small black eyes， very close， staring into his own. he looked away. there were two cuts on popé’s left shoulder. “oh， look at the blood！” linda was crying. “look at the blood！” she had never been able to bear the sight of blood. popé lifted his other hand–to strike him， he thought. he stiffened to receive the blow. but the hand only took him under the chin and turned his face， so that he had to look again into popé’s eyes. for a long time， for hours and hours. and suddenly–he couldn’t help it–he began to cry. popé burst out laughing. “go，” he said， in the other indian words. “go， my brave ahaiyuta.” he ran out into the other room to hide his tears.

　　“you are fifteen，” said old mitsima， in the indian words. “now i may teach you to work the clay.”

　　squatting by the river， they worked together.

　　“first of all，” said mitsima， taking a lump of the wetted clay between his hands， “we make a little moon.” the old man squeezed the lump into a disk， then bent up the edges， the moon became a shallow cup.

　　slowly and unskilfully he imitated the old man’s delicate gestures.

　　“a moon， a cup， and now a snake.” mitsima rolled out another piece of clay into a long flexible cylinder， trooped it into a circle and pressed it on to the rim of the cup. “then another snake. and another. and another.” round by round， mitsima built up the sides of the pot； it was narrow， it bulged， it narrowed again towards the neck. mitsima squeezed and patted， stroked and scraped； and there at last it stood， in shape the familiar water pot of malpais， but creamy white instead of black， and still soft to the touch. the crooked parody of mitsima’s， his own stood beside it. looking at the two pots， he had to laugh.

　　“but the next one will be better，” he said， and began to moisten another piece of clay.

　　to fashion， to give form， to feel his fingers gaining in skill and power–this gave him an extraordinary pleasure. “a， b， c， vitamin d，” he sang to himself as he worked. “the fat’s in the liver， the cod’s in the sea.” and mitsima also sang–a song about killing a bear. they worked all day， and all day he was filled with an intense， absorbing happiness.

　　“next winter，” said old mitsima， “i will teach you to make the bow.”

第65章 Chapter Eight(4)


　　he stood for a long time outside the house， and at last the ceremonies within were finished. the door opened； they came out. kothlu came first， his right hand out-stretched and tightly closed， as though over some precious jewel. her clenched hand similarly outstretched， kiakimé followed. they walked in silence， and in silence， behind them， came the brothers and sisters and cousins and all the troop of old people.

　　they walked out of the pueblo， across the mesa. at the edge of the clid they halted， facing the early morning sun. kothlu opened his hand. a pinch of corn meal lay white on the palm； he breathed on it， murmured a few words， then threw it， a handful of white dust， towards the sun. kiakimé did the same. then khakimé’s father stepped forward， and holding up a feathered prayer stick， made a long prayer， then threw the stick after the corn meal.

　　“it is finished，” said old mitsima in a loud voice. “they are married.”

　　“well，” said linda， as they turned away， “all i can say is， it does seem a lot of fuss to make about so little. in civilized countries， when a boy wants to have a girl， he just…but where are you going， john？”

　　he paid no attention to her calling， but ran on， away， away， anywhere to be by himself.

　　it is finished old mitsima’s words repeated themselves in his mind. finished， finished…in silence and frum a long way off， but violently， desperately， hopelessly， he had loved kiakimé. and now it was finished. he was sixteen.

　　at the full moon， in the antelope kiva， secrets would be told， secrets would be done and borne. they woud go down， boys， into the kiva and come out again， men. the boys were all afraid and at the same time impatient. and at last it was the day. the sun went down， the moon rose. he went with the others. men were standing， dark， at the entrance to the kiva； the ladder went down into the red lighted depths. already the leading boys had begun to climb down. suddenly， one of the men stepped forward， caught him by the arm， and pulled him out of the ranks. he broke free and dodged back into his place among the others. this time the man struck him， pulled his hair. “not for you， white-hair！” “not for the son of the she-dog，” said one of the other men. the boys laughed. “go！” and as he still hovered on the fringes of the group， “go！” the men shouted again. one of them bent down， took a stone， threw it. “go， go， go！” there was a shower of stones. bleeding， he ran away into the darkness. from the red-lit kiva came the noise of singing. the last of the boys had climbed down the ladder. he was all alone.

　　all alone， outside the pueblo， on the bare plain of the mesa. the rock was like bleached bones in the moonlight. down in the valley， the coyotes were howling at the moon. the bruises hurt him， the cuts were still bleeding； but it was not for pain that he sobbed； it was because he was all alone， because he had been driven out， alone， into this skeleton world of rocks and moonlight. at the edge of the precipice he sat down. the moon was behind him； he looked down into the black shadow of the mesa， into the black shadow of death. he had only to take one step， one little jump.…he held out his right hand in the moonlight. from the cut on his wrist the blood was still oozing. every few seconds a drop fell， dark， almost colourless in the dead light. drop， drop， drop. to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow…

　　he had discovered time and death and god.

　　“alone， always alone，” the young man was saying.

　　the words awoke a plaintive echo in bernard’s mind. alone， alone…“so am i，” he said， on a gush of confidingness. “terribly alone.”

　　“are you？” john looked surprised. “i thought that in the other place…i mean， linda always said that nobody was ever alone there.”

第66章 Chapter Eight(5)


　　bernard blushed uncomfortably. “you see，” he said， mumbling and with averted eyes， “i’m rather different from most people， i suppose. if one happens to be decanted different…”

　　“yes， that’s just it.” the young man nodded. “if one’s different， one’s bound to be lonely. they’re beastly to one. do you know， they shut me out of absolutely everything？ when the other boys were sent out to spend the night on the mountains–you know， when you have to dream which your sacred animal is–they wouldn’t let me go with the others； they wouldn’t tell me any of the secrets. i did it by myself， though，” he added. “didn’t eat anything for five days and then went out one night alone into those mountains there.” he pointed.

　　patronizingly， bernard smiled. “and did you dream of anything？” he asked.

　　the other nodded. “but i mustn’t tell you what.” he was silent for a little； then， in a low voice， “once，” he went on， “i did something that none of the others did： i stood against a rock in the middle of the day， in summer， with my arms out， like jesus on the cross.”

　　“what on earth for？”

　　“i wanted to know what it was like being crucified. hanging there in the sun…”

　　“but why？”

　　“why？ well…” he hesitated. “because i felt i ought to. if jesus could stand it. and then， if one has done something wrong…besides， i was unhappy； that was another reason.”

　　“it seems a funny way of curing your unhappiness，” said bernard. but on second thoughts he decided that there was， after all， some sense in it. better than taking soma…

　　“i fainted after a time，” said the young man. “fell down on my face. do you see the mark where i cut myself？” he lifted the thick yellow hair from his forehead. the scar showed， pale and puckered， on his right temple.

　　bernard looked， and then quickly， with a little shudder， averted his eyes. his conditioning had made him not so much pitiful as profoundly squeamish. the mere suggestion of illness or wounds was to him not only horrifying， but even repulsive and rather disgusting. like dirt， or deformity， or old age. hastily he changed the subject.

　　“i wonder if you’d like to come back to london with us？” he asked， making the first move in a campaign whose strategy he had been secretly elaborating ever since， in the little house， he had reahzed who the “father” of this young savage must be. “would you like that？”

　　the young man’s face lit up. “do you really mean it？”

　　“of course； if i can get permission， that is.”

　　“linda too？”

　　“well…” he hesitated doubtfully. that revolting creature！ no， it was impossible. unless， unless…it suddenly occurred to bernard that her very revoltingness might prove an enormous asset. “but of course！” he cried， making up for his first hesitations with an excess of noisy cordiality.

　　the young man drew a deep breath. “to think it should be coming true–what i’ve dreamt of all my life. do you remember what miranda says？”

　　“who’s miranda？”

　　but the young man had evidently not heard the question. “o wonder！” he was saying； and his eyes shone， his face was brightly flushed. “how many goodly creatures are there here！ how beauteous mankind is！” the flush suddenly deepened； he was thinking of lenina， of an angel in bottle-green viscose， lustrous with youth and skin food， plump， benevolently smiling. his voice faltered. “o brave new world，” he began， then-suddenly interrupted himself； the blood had left his cheeks； he was as pale as paper.

　　“are you married to her？” he asked.

　　“am i what？”

　　“married. you know–for ever. they say ‘for ever’ in the indian words； it can’t be broken.”

　　“ford， no！” bernard couldn’t help laughing.

　　john also laughed， but for another reason–laughed for pure joy.

　　“o brave new world，” he repeated. “o brave new world that has such people in it. let’s start at once.”

　　“you have a most peculiar way of talking sometimes，” said bernard， staring at the young man in perplexed astonishment. “and， anyhow， hadn’t you better wait till you actually see the new world？”

第67章 Chapter Nine(1)


　　lenina felt herself entitled， after this day of queerness and horror， to a complete and absolute holiday. as soon as they got back to the rest-house， she swallowed six half-gramme tablets of soma， lay down on her bed， and within ten minutes had embarked for lunar eternity. it would be eighteen hours at the least before she was in time again.

　　bernard meanwhile lay pensive and wide-eyed in the dark. it was long after midnight before he fell asleep. long after midnight； but his insomnia had not been fruitless； he had a plan.

　　punctually， on the following morning， at ten o’clock， the green-uniformed octoroon stepped out of his helicopter. hemard was waiting for him among the agaves.

　　“miss crowne’s gone on soma-holiday，” he explained. “can hardly be back before five， which leaves us seven hours.”

　　he could fly to santa fé， do all the business he had to do， and be in malpais again long before she woke up.

　　“she’ll be quite safe here by herself？”

　　“safe as helicoplers，” the octoroon assured him.

　　they climbed into the machine and started off at once. at ten thirty-four they landed on the roof of the santa fé post office； at ten thirty-seven bernard had got through to the world controller’s office in whitehall； at ten thirty-seven he was speaking to his fordship’s fourth personal secretary； at ten forty-four he was repeating his story to the first secretary， and at ten forty-seven and a half it was the deep， resonant voice of mustapha mond himself that sounded in his ears.

　　“i ventured to think，” stammered bernard， “that your fordship might find the matter of sufficient scientific interest…”

　　“yes， i do find it of sufficient scientific interest，” said the deep voice. “bring these two individuals back to london with you.”

　　“your fordship is aware that i shall need a special permit…”

　　“the necessary orders，” said mustapha mond， “are being sent to the warden of the reservation at this moment. you will proceed at once to the warden’s office. good-morning， mr. marx.”

　　there was silence. bernard hung up the receiver and hurried up to the roof.

　　“warden’s office，” he said to the gamma-green octoroon.

　　at ten fifty-four bernard was shaking hands with the warden.

　　“delighted， mr. marx， delighted.” his boom was deferential. “we have just received special orders…”

　　“i know，” said bernard， interrupting him. “i was talking to his fordship on the phone a moment ago.” his bored tone implied that he was in the habit of talking to his fordship every day of the week. he dropped into a chair. “if you’ll kindly take all the necessary steps as soon as possible. as soon as possible，” he emphatically repeated. he was thoroughly enjoying himself.

　　at eleven three he had all the necessary papers in his pocket.

　　“so long，” he said patronizingly to the warden， who had accompanied him as far as the lift gates. “so long.”

　　he walked across to the hotel， had a bath， a vibro-vac massage， and an electrolytic shave， listened in to the morning’s news， looked in for half an hour on the televisor， ate a leisured luncheon， and at half-past two flew back with the octoroon to malpais.

　　the young man stood outside the rest-house.

　　“bernard，” he called. “bernard！” there was no answer.

　　noiseless on his deerksin moccasins， he ran up the steps and tried the door. the door was locked.

　　they were gone！ gone！ it was the most terrible thing that had ever happened to him. she had asked him to come and see them， and now they were gone. he sat down on the steps and cried.

第68章 Chapter Nine(2)


　　half an hour later it occurred to him to look through the window. the first thing he saw was a green suit-case， with the initials l.c. painted on the lid. joy flared up like fire within him. he picked up a stone. the smashed glass tinkled on the floor. a moment later he was inside the room. he opened the green suit-case； and all at once he was breathing lenina’s perfume， filling his lungs with her essential being. his heart beat wildly； for a moment he was almost faint. then， bending over the precious box， he touched， he lifted into the light， he examined. the zippers on lenina’s spare pair of viscose velveteen shorts were at first a puzzle， then solved， a delight. zip， and then zip； zip， and then zip； he was enchanted. her green slippers were the most beautiful things he had ever seen. he unfolded a pair of zippicamiknicks， blushed， put them hastily away again； but kissed a perfumed acetate handkerchief and wound a scarf round his neck. opening a box， he spilt a cloud of scented powder. his hands were floury with the stuff. he wiped them on his chest， on his shoulders， on his bare arms. delicious perfume！ he shut his eyes； he rubbed his cheek against his own powdered arm. touch of smooth skin against his face， scent in his nostrils of musky dust–her real presence. “lenina，” he whispered. “lenina！”

　　a noise made him start， made him guiltily turn. he crammed up his thieveries into the suit-case and shut the lid； then listened again， looked. not a sign of life， not a sound. and yet he had certainly heard something–something like a sigh， something like the creak of a board. he tiptoed to the door and， cautiously opening it， found himself looking on to a broad landing. on the opposite side of the landing was another door， ajar. he stepped out， pushed， peeped.

　　there， on a low bed， the sheet flung back， dressed in a pair of pink one-piece zippyjamas， lay lenina， fast asleep and so beautiful in the midst of her curls， so touchingly childish with her pink toes and her grave sleeping face， so trustful in the helplessness of her limp hands and melted limbs， that the tears came to his eyes.

　　with an infinity of quite unnecessary precautions–for nothing short of a pistol shot could have called lenina back from her soma-holiday before the appointed time–he entered the room， he knelt on the floor beside the bed. he gazed， he clasped his hands， his lips moved. “her eyes，” he murmured，

　　“her eyes， her hair， her cheek， her gait， her voice； handlest in thy discourse o！ that her hand， in whose comparison all whites are ink writing their own reproach； to whose soft seizure the cygnet’s down is harsh…”

　　a fly buzzed round her； he waved it away. “flies，” he remembered，

　　“on the white wonder of dear juliet’s hand， may seize. and steal immortal blessing from her lips， who， even in pure and vestal modesty， still blush， as thinking their own kisses sin.”

　　very slowly， with the hesitating gesture of one who reaches forward to stroke a shy and possibly rather dangerous bird， he put out his hand. it hung there trembling， within an inch of those limp fingers， on the verge of contact. did he dare？ dare to profane with his unworthiest hand that…no， he didn’t. the bird was too dangerous. his hand dropped back. how beautiful she was！ how beautiful！

　　then suddenly he found himself reflecting that he had only to take hold of the zipper at her neck and give one long， strong pull…he shut his eyes， he shook his head with the gesture of a dog shaking its ears as it emerges from the water. detestable thought！ he was ashamed of himself. pure and vestal modesty…

　　there was a humming in the air. another fly trying to steal immortal blessings？ a wasp？ he looked， saw nothing. the humming grew louder and louder， localized itself as being outside the shuttered windows. the plane！ in a panic， he scrambled to his feet and ran into the other room， vaulted through the open window， and hurrying along the path between the tall agaves was in time to receive bernard marx as he climbed out of the helicopter.

　　the hands of all the four thousand electric clocks in all the bloomsbury centre’s four thousand rooms marked twenty-seven minutes past two. “this hive of industry，” as the director was fond of calling it， was in the full buzz of work. every one was busy， everything in ordered motion. under the microscopes， their long tails furiously lashing， spermatozoa were burrowing head first into eggs； and， fertilized， the eggs were expanding， dividing， or if bokanovskified， budding and breaking up into whole populations of separate embryos. from the social predestination room the escalators went rumbling down into the basement， and there， in the crimson darkness， stewingly warm on their cushion of peritoneum and gorged with blood-surrogate and hormones， the foetuses grew and grew or， poisoned， languished into a stunted epsilonhood. with a faint hum and rattle the moving racks crawled imperceptibly through the weeks and the recapitulated aeons to where， in the decanting room， the newly-unbottled babes uttered their first yell of horror and amazement.

　　the dynamos purred in the sub-basement， the lifts rushed up and down. on all the eleven floors of nurseries it was feeding time. from eighteen hundred bottles eighteen hundred carefully labelled infants were simultaneously sucking down their pint of pasteurized external secretion.

　　above them， in ten successive layers of dormitory， the little boys and girls who were still young enough to need an afternoon sleep were as busy as every one else， though they did not know it， listening unconsciously to hypnop？dic lessons in hygiene and sociability， in class-consciousness and the toddler’s love-life. above these again were the playrooms where， the weather having turned to rain， nine hundred older children were amusing themselves with bricks and clay modelling， hunt-the-zipper， and erotic play.

　　buzz， buzz！ the hive was humming， busily， joyfully. blithe was the singing of the young girls over their test-tubes， the predestinators whistled as they worked， and in the decanting room what glorious jokes were cracked above the empty bottles！ but the director’s face， as he entered the fertilizing room with henry foster， was grave， wooden with severity.

　　“a public example，” he was saying. “in this room， because it contains more high-caste workers than any other in the centre. i have told him to meet me here at half-past two.”

　　“he does his work very well，” put in henry， with hypocritical generosity.

　　“i know. but that’s all the more reason for severity. his intellectual eminence carries with it corresponding moral responsibilities. the greater a man’s talents， the greater his power to lead astray. it is better that one should suffer than that many should be corrupted. consider the matter dispassionately， mr. foster， and you will see that no offence is so henious as unorthodoxy of behaviour. murder kills only the individual–and， after all， what is an individual？” with a sweeping gesture he indicated the rows of microscopes， the test-tubes， the incubators. “we can make a new one with the greatest ease–as many as we like. unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual； it strikes at society itseff. yes， at society itself，” he repeated. “ah， but here he comes.”

　　bernard had entered the room and was advancing between the rows of fertilizers towards them. a veneer of jaunty self-confidence thinly concealed his nervousness. the voice in which he said， “good-morning， director，” was absurdly too loud； that in which， correcting his rnistake， he said， “you asked me to come and speak to you here，” ridiculously soft， a squeak.

　　“yes， mr. marx，” said the director portentously. “i did ask you to come to me here. you returned from your holiday last night， i understand.”

　　“yes，” bernard answered.

　　“yes-s，” repeated the director， lingering， a serpent， on the “s”. then， suddenly raising his voice， “ladies and gentlemen，” he trumpeted， “ladies and gentlemen.”

　　the singing of the girls over their test-tubes， the preoccupied whistling of the microscopists， suddenly ceased. there was a profound silence； every one looked round.

第70章 Chapter Ten(2)


　　“ladies and gentlemen，” the director repeated once more， “excuse me for thus interrupting your labours. a painful duty constrains me. the security and stability of society are in danger. yes， in danger， ladies and gentlemen. this man，” he pointed accusingly at bernard， “this man who stands before you here， this alpha-plus to whom so much has been given， and from whom， in consequence， so much must be expected， this colleague of yours–or should i anticipate and say this ex-colleague？–has grossly betrayed the trust imposed in him. by his heretical views on sport and soma， by the scandalous unorthodoxy of his sex-life， by his refusal to obey the teachings of our ford and behave out of office hours， ‘even as a little infant，’” （here the director made the sign of the t）， “he has proved himself an enemy of society， a subverter， ladies and gentlemen， of all order and stability， a conspirator against civilization itself. for this reason i propose to dismiss him， to dismiss him with ignominy from the post he has held in this centre； i propose forthwith to apply for his transference to a subcentre of the lowest order and， that his punishment may serve the best interest of society， as far as possible removed from any important centre of population. in iceland he will have small opportunity to lead others astray by his unfordly example.” the director paused； then， folding his arms， he turned impressively to bernard. “marx，” he said， “can you show any reason why i should not now execute the judgment passed upon you？”

　　“yes， i can，” bernard answered in a very loud voice.

　　somewhat taken aback， but still majestically， “then show it，” said the director.

　　“certainly. but it’s in the passage. one moment.” bernard hurried to the door and threw it open. “come in，” he commanded， and the reason came in and showed itself.

　　there was a gasp， a murmur of astonishment and horror； a young girl screamed； standing on a chair to get a better view some one upset two test-tubes full of spermatozoa. bloated， sagging， and among those firm youthful bodies， those undistorted faces， a strange and terrifying monster of middle-agedness， linda advanced into the room， coquettishly smiling her broken and discoloured smile， and rolling as she walked， with what was meant to be a voluptuous undulation， her enormous haunches. bernard walked beside her.

　　“there he is，” he said， pointing at the director.

　　“did you think i didn’t recognize him？” linda asked indignantly； then， turning to the director， “of course i knew you； tomakin， i should have known you anywhere， among a thousand. but perhaps you’ve forgotten me. don’t you remember？ don’t you remember， tomakin？ your linda.” she stood looking at him， her head on one side， still smiling， but with a smile that became progressively， in face of the director’s expression of petrified disgust， less and less self-confident， that wavered and finally went out. “don’t you remember， tomakin？” she repeated in a voice that trembled. her eyes were anxious， agonized. the blotched and sagging face twisted grotesquely into the grimace of extreme grief. “tomakin！” she held out her arms. some one began to titter.

　　“what’s the meaning，” began the director， “of this monstrous…”

　　“tomakin！” she ran forward， her blanket trailing behind her， threw her arms round his neck， hid her face on his chest.

　　a howl of laughter went up irrepressibly.

　　“…this monstrous practical joke，” the director shouted.

　　red in the face， he tried to disengage himself from her embrace. desperately she clung. “but i’m linda， i’m linda.” the laughter drowned her voice. “you made me have a baby，” she screamed above the uproar. there was a sudden and appalling hush； eyes floated uncomfortably， not knowing where to look. the director went suddenly pale， stopped struggling and stood， his hands on her wrists， staring down at her， horrified. “yes， a baby–and i was its mother.” she flung the obscenity like a challenge into the outraged silence； then， suddenly breaking away from him， ashamed， ashamed， covered her face with her hands， sobbing. “it wasn’t my fault， tomakin. because i always did my drill， didn’t i？ didn’t i？ always…i don’t know how…if you knew how awful， tomakin…but he was a comfort to me， all the same.” turning towards the door， “john！” she called. “john！”

　　he came in at once， paused for a moment just inside the door， looked round， then soft on his moccasined feet strode quickly across the room， fell on his knees in front of the director， and said in a clear voice： “my father！”

　　the word （for “father” was not so much obscene as–with its connotation of something at one remove from the loathsomeness and moral obliquity of child-bearing–merely gross， a scatological rather than a pornographic impropriety）； the comically smutty word relieved what had become a quite intolerable tension. laughter broke out， enormous， almost hysterical， peal after peal， as though it would never stop. my father–and it was the director！ my father！ oh ford， oh ford！ that was really too good. the whooping and the roaring renewed themselves， faces seemed on the point of disintegration， tears were streaming. six more test-tubes of spermatozoa were upset. my father！

　　pale， wild-eyed， the director glared about him in an agony of bewildered humiliation.

　　my father！ the laughter， which had shown signs of dying away， broke out again more loudly than ever. he put his hands over his ears and rushed out of the room.

第71章 Chapter Eleven(1)


　　after the scene in the fertilizing room， all upper-caste london was wild to see this delicious creature who had fallen on his knees before the director of hatcheries and conditioning–or rather the ex-director， for the poor man had resigned immediately afterwards and never set foot inside the centre again–had flopped down and called him （the joke was almost too good to be true！） “my father.” linda， on the contrary， cut no ice； nobody had the smallest desire to see linda. to say one was a mother–that was past a joke： it was an obscenity. moreover， she wasn’t a real savage， had been hatched out of a bottle and conditioned like any one else： so coudn’t have really quaint ideas. finally–and this was by far the strongest reason for people’s not wanting to see poor linda–there was her appearance. fat； having lost her youth； with bad teeth， and a blotched complexion， and that figure （ford！）–you simply couldn’t look at her without feeling sick， yes， positively sick. so the best people were quite determined not to see linda. and linda， for her part， had no desire to see them. the return to civilization was for her the return to soma， was the possibility of lying in bed and taking holiday after holiday， without ever having to come back to a headache or a fit of vomiting， without ever being made to feel as you always felt after peyotl， as though you’d done something so shamefully anti-social that you could never hold up your head again. soma played none of these unpleasant tricks. the holiday it gave was perfect and， if the morning after was disagreeable， it was so， not intrinsically， but only by comparison with the joys of the holiday. the remedy was to make the holiday continuous. greedily she clamoured for ever larger， ever more frequent doses. dr. shaw at first demurred； then let her have what she wanted. she took as much as twenty grammes a day.

　　“which will finish her off in a month or two，” the doctor confided to bernard. “one day the respiratory centre will be paralyzed. no more breathing. finished. and a good thing too. if we could rejuvenate， of course it would be different. but we can’t.”

　　surprisingly， as every one thought （for on soma-holiday linda was most conveniently out of the way）， john raised objections.

　　“but aren’t you shortening her life by giving her so much？”

　　“in one sense， yes，” dr. shaw admitted. “but in another we’re actually lengthening it.” the young man stared， uncomprehending. “soma may make you lose a few years in time，” the doctor went on. “but think of the enornous， immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eternity.”

　　john began to understand. “eternity was in our lips and eyes，” he murmured.

　　“eh？”

　　“nothing.”

　　“of course，” dr. shaw went on， “you can’t allow people to go popping off into eternity if they’ve got any serious work to do. but as she hasn’t got any serious work…”

　　“all the same，” john persisted， “i don’t believe it’s right.”

　　the doctor shrugged his shoulders. “well， of course， if you prefer to have her screaming mad all the time…”

　　in the end john was forced to give in. linda got her soma. thenceforward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of bernard’s apartment house， in bed， with the radio and television always on， and the patchouli tap just dripping， and the soma tablets within reach of her hand–there she remained； and yet wasn’t there at all， was all the time away， infinitely far away， on holiday； on holiday in some other world， where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of sonorous colours， a sliding， palpitating labyrinth， that led （by what beautifully inevitable windings） to a bright centre of absolute conviction； where the dancing images of the television box were the performers in some indescribably delicious all-singing feely； where the dripping patchouli was more than scent–was the sun， was a million saxophones， was popé making love， only much more so， incomparably more， and without end.

　　“no， we can’t rejuvenate. but i’m very glad，” dr. shaw had concluded， “to have had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human being. thank you so much for calling me in.” he shook bernard warmly by the hand.

　　it was john， then， they were all after. and as it was only through bernard， his accredited guardian， that john could be seen， bernard now found himself， for the first time in his life， treated not merely normally， but as a person of outstanding importance. there was no more talk of the alcohol in his blood-surrogate， no gibes at his personal appearance. henry foster went out of his way to be friendly； benito hoover made him a present of six packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum； the assistant predestinator came out and cadged almost abjectly for an invitation to one of bernard’s evening parties. as for the women， bernard had only to hint at the possibility of an invitation， and he could have whichever of them he liked.

　　“bernard’s asked me to meet the savage next wednesday，” fanny announced triumphantly.

　　“i’m so glad，” said lenina. “and now you must admit that you were wrong about bernard. don’t you think he’s really rather sweet？”

　　fanny nodded. “and i must say，” she said， “i was quite agreeably surprised.”

　　the chief bottler， the director of predestination， three deputy assistant fertilizer-generals， the professor of feelies in the college of emotional engineering， the dean of the westminster community singery， the supervisor of bokanovskification–the list of bernard’s notabilities was interminable.

　　“and i had six girls last week，” he confided to helmholtz watson. “one on monday， two on tuesday， two more on friday， and one on saturday. and if i’d had the time or the inclination， there were at least a dozen more who were only too anxious…”

　　helmholtz listened to his boastings in a silence so gloomily disapproving that bernard was offended.

　　“you’re envious，” he said.

　　helmholtz shook his head. “i’m rather sad， that’s all，” he answered.

　　bernard went off in a huff. never， he told himself， never would he speak to helmholtz again.

第72章 Chapter Eleven(2)


　　the days passed. success went fizzily to bernard’s head， and in the process completely reconciled him （as any good intoxicant should do） to a world which， up till then， he had found very unsatisfactory. in so far as it recognized him as important， the order of things was good. but， reconciled by his success， he yet refused to forego the privilege of criticizing this order. for the act of criticizing heightened his sense of importance， made him feel larger. moreover， he did genuinely believe that there were things to criticize. （at the same time， he genuinely liked being a success and having all the girls he wanted.） before those who now， for the sake of the savage， paid their court to him， bernard would parade a carping unorthodoxy. he was politely listened to. but behind his back people shook their heads. “that young man will come to a bad end，” they said， prophesying the more confidently in that they themselves would in due course personally see to it that the end was bad. “he won’t find another savage to help him out a second time，” they said. meanwhile， however， there was the first savage； they were polite. and because they were polite， bernard felt positively gigantic–gigantic and at the same time light with elation， lighter than air.

　　“lighter than air，” said bernard， pointing upwards.

　　like a pearl in the sky， high， high above them， the weather department’s captive balloon shone rosily in the sunshine.

　　“…the said savage，” so ran bernard’s instructions， “to be shown civilized life in all its aspects.…”

　　he was being shown a bird’s-eye view of it at present， a bird’s-eye view from the platform of the charing-t tower. the station master and the resident meteorologist were acting as guides. but it was bernard who did most of the talking. intoxicated， he was behaving as though， at the very least， he were a visiting world controller. lighter than air.

　　the bombay green rocket dropped out of the sky. the passengers alighted. eight identical dravidian twins in khaki looked out of the eight portholes of the cabin–the stewards.

　　“twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour，” said the station master impressively. “what do you think of that， mr. savage？”

　　john thought it very nice. “still，” he said， “ariel could put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.”

　　“the savage，” wrote bernard in his report to mustapha mond， “shows surprisingly little astonishment at， or awe of， civilized inventions. this is partly due， no doubt， to the fact that he has heard them talked about by the woman linda， his m–––.”

　　（mustapha mond frowned. “does the fool think i’m too squeamish to see the word written out at full length？”）

　　“partly on his interest being focussed on what he calls ’the soul，’ which he persists in regarding as an entity independent of the physical environment， whereas， as i tried to point out to him…”

　　the controller skipped the next sentences and was just about to turn the page in search of something more interestingly concrete， when his eye was caught by a series of quite extraordinary phrases. “…though i must admit，” he read， “that i agree with the savage in finding civilized infantility too easy or， as he puts it， not expensive enough； and i would like to take this opportunity of drawing your fordship’s attention to…”

　　mustapha mond’s anger gave place almost at once to mirth. the idea of this creature solemnly lecturing him–him-about the social order was really too grotesque. the man must have gone mad. “i ought to give him a lesson，” he said to hiniself； then threw back his head and haughed aloud. for the moment， at any rate， the lesson would not be given.

　　it was a small factory of lighting-sets for helicopters， a branch of the electrical equipment corporation. they were met on the roof itself （for that circular letter of recommendation from the controller was magical in its effects） by the chief technician and the human element manager. they walked downstairs into the factory.

　　“each process，” explained the human element manager， “is carried out， so far as possible， by a single bokanovsky group.”

　　and， in effect， eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic deltas were cold-pressing. the fifty-six four-spindle chucking and turning machines were being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger gammas. one hundred and seven heat-conditioned epsilon senegalese were working in the foundry. thirty-three delta females， long-headed， sandy， with narrow pelvises， and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall， were cutting screws. in the assembling room， the dynamos were being put together by two sets of gamma-plus dwarfs. the two low work-tables faced one another； between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts； forty-seven blonde heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks； forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. the completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in gamma green， packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged， left-handed male delta-minuses， and loaded into the waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed， flaxen and freckled epsilon semi-morons.

　　“o brave new world…” by some malice of his memory the savage found himself repeating miranda’s words. “o brave new world that has such people in it.”

　　“and i assure you，” the human element manager concluded， as they left the factory， “we hardly ever have any trouble with our workers. we always find…”

　　but the savage had suddenly broken away from his companions and was violently retching， behind a clump of laurels， as though the solid earth had been a helicopter in an air pocket.

　　“the savage，” wrote bernard， “refuses to take soma， and seems much distressed because of the woman linda， his m–––， remains permanently on holiday. it is worthy of note that， in spite of his m–––’s senility and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance， the savage frequently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her–an interesting example of the way in which early conditioning can be made to modify and even run counter to natural impulses （in this case， the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object）.”

第73章 Chapter Eleven(3)


　　at eton they alighted on the roof of upper school. on the opposite side of school yard， the fifty-two stories of lupton’s tower gleamed white in the sunshine. college on their left and， on their right， the school community singery reared their venerable piles of ferro-concrete and vita-glass. in the centre of the quadrangle stood the quaint old chrome-steel statue of our ford.

　　dr. gaffney， the provost， and miss keate， the head mistress， received them as they stepped out of the plane.

　　“do you have many twins here？” the savage asked rather apprehensively， as they set out on their tour of inspection.

　　“oh， no，” the provost answered. “eton is reserved exclusively for upper-caste boys and girls. one egg， one adult. it makes education more difficult of course. but as they’ll be called upon to take responsibilities and deal with unexpected emergencies， it can’t be helped.” he sighed.

　　bernard， meanwhile， had taken a strong fancy to miss keate. “if you’re free any monday， wednesday， or friday evening，” he was saying. jerking his thumb towards the savage， “he’s curious， you know，” bernard added. “quaint.”

　　miss keate smiled （and her smile was really charming， he thought）； said thank you； would be delighted to come to one of his parties. the provost opened a door.

　　five minutes in that alpha double plus classroom left john a trifle bewildered.

　　“what is elementary relativity？” he whispered to bernard. bernard tried to explain， then thought better of it and suggested that they should go to some other classroom.

　　from behind a door in the corridor leading to the beta-minus geography room， a ringing soprano voice called， “one， two， three， four，” and then， with a weary impatience， “as you were.”

　　“malthusian drill，” explained the head mistress. “most of our girls are freemartins， of course. i’m a freemartin myself.” she smiled at bernard. “but we have about eight hundred unsterilized ones who need constant drilling.”

　　in the beta-minus geography room john learnt that “a savage reservation is a place which， owing to unfavourable climatic or geological conditions， or poverty of natural resources， has not been worth the expense of civilizing”. a click； the room was darkened； and suddenly， on the screen above the master’s head， there were the penitentes of acoma prostrating themselves before our lady， and wailing as john had heard them wail， confessing their sins before jesus on the cross， before the eagle image of pookong. the young etonians fairly shouted with laughter. still wailing， the penitentes rose to their feet， stripped off their upper garments and， with knotted whips， began to beat themselves， blow after blow. redoubled， the laughted drowned even the amplified record of their groans.

　　“but why do they laugh？” asked the savage in a pained bewilderment.

　　“why？” the provost turned towards him a still broadly grinning face. “why？ but because it’s so extraordinarily funny.”

　　in the cinematographic twilight， bernard risked a gesture which， in the past， even total darkness would hardly have emboldened him to make. strong in his new importance， he put his arm around the head mistress’s waist. it yielded， willowily. he was just about to snatch a kiss or two and perhaps a gentle pinch， when the shutters clicked open again.

　　“perhaps we had better go on，” said miss keate， and moved towards the door.

　　“and this，” said the provost a moment later， “is hypnop？dic control room.”

　　hundreds of synthetic music boxes， one for each dormitory， stood ranged in shelves round three sides of the room； pigeon-holed on the fourth were the paper sound-track rolls on which the various hypnop？dic lessons were printed.

　　“you slip the roll in here，” explained bernard， initerrupting dr. gaffney， “press down this switch…”

　　“no， that one，” corrected the provost， annoyed.

　　“that one， then. the roll unwinds. the selenium cells transform the light impulses into sound waves， and…”

　　“and there you are，” dr. gaffney concluded.

　　“do they read shakespeare？” asked the savage as they walked， on their way to the bio-chemical laboratories， past the school library.

　　“certainly not，” said the head mistress， blushing.

　　“our library，” said dr. gaffney， “contains only books of reference. if our young people need distraction， they can get it at the feelies. we don’t encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.”

　　five bus-loads of boys and girls， singing or in a silent embracement， rolled past them over the vitrified highway.

　　“just returned，” explained dr. gaffney， while bernard， whispering， made an appointment with the head mistress for that very evening， “from the slough crematorium. death conditioning begins at eighteen months. every tot spends two mornings a week in a hospital for the dying. all the best toys are kept there， and they get chocolate cream on death days. they learn to take dying as a matter of course.”

　　“like any other physiological process，” put in the head mistress professionally.

　　eight o’clock at the savoy. it was all arranged.

　　on their way back to london they stopped at the television corporation’s factory at brentford.

　　“do you mind waiting here a moment while i go and telephone？” asked bernard.

　　the savage waited and watched. the main day-shift was just going off duty. crowds of lower-caste workers were queued up in front of the monorail station-seven or eight hundred gamma， delta and epsilon men and women， with not more than a dozen faces and statures between them. to each of them， with his or her ticket， the booking clerk pushed over a little cardboard pillbox. the long caterpillar of men and women moved slowly forward.

　　“what’s in those” （remembering the merchant of venice） “those caskets？” the savage enquired when bernard had rejoined him.

　　“the day’s soma ration，” bernard answered rather indistinctly； for he was masticating a piece of benito hoover’s chewing-gum. “they get it after their work’s over. four half-gramme tablets. six on saturdays.”

　　he took john’s arm affectionately and they walked back towards the helicopter.

　　lenina came singing into the changing room.

　　“you seem very pleased with yourself，” said fanny.

　　“i am pleased，” she answered. zip！ “bernard rang up half an hour ago.” zip， zip！ she stepped out of her shorts. “he has an unexpected engagement.” zip！ “asked me if i’d take the savage to the feelies this evening. i must fly.” she hurried away towards the bathroom.

　　“she’s a lucky girl，” fanny said to herself as she watched lenina go.

　　there was no envy in the comment； good-natured fanny was merely stating a faet. lenina was lucky； lucky in having shared with bernard a generous portion of the savage’s immense celebrity， lucky in reflecting from her insignificant person the moment’s supremely fashionable glory. had not the secretary of the young women’s fordian association asked her to give a lecture about her experiences？ had she not been invited to the annual dinner of the aphroditeum club？ had she not already appeared in the feelytone news–visibly， audibly and tactually appeared to countless millions all over the planet？

　　hardly less flattering had been the attentions paid her by conspicuous individuals.

　　the resident world controller’s second secretary had asked her to dinner and breakfast. she had spent one week-end with the ford chief-justice， and another with the arch-community-songster of canterbury. the president of the internal and external secretions corporation was perpetually on the phone， and she had been to deauville with the deputy-governor of the bank of europe.

　　“it’s wonderful， of course. and yet in a way，” she had confessed to fanny， “i feel as though i were getting something on false presences. because， of course， the first thing they all want to know is what it’s like to make love to a savage. and i have to say i don’t know.” she shook her head. “most of the men don’t believe me， of course. but it’s true. i wish it weren’t，” she added sadly and sighed. “he’s terribly good-looking； don’t you think so？”

　　“but doesn’t he like you？” asked fanny.

　　“sometimes i think he does and sometimes i think he doesn’t. he always does his best to avoid me； goes out of the room when i come in； won’t touch me； won’t even look at me. but sometimes if i turn round suddenly， i catch him staring； and then–well， you know how men look when they like you.”

　　yes， fanny knew.

　　“i can’t make it out，” said lenina.

　　she couldn’t make it out； and not only was bewildered； was also rather upset.

　　“because， you see， fanny， i like him.”

　　liked him more and more. well， now there’d be a real chance， she thought， as she scented herself after her bath. dab， dab， dab–a real chance. her high spirits overflowed in a song.

　　“hug me till you drug me， honey； kiss me till i’m in a coma； hug me， honey， snuggly bunny； love’s as good as soma.”

　　the scent organ was playing a delightfully refreshing herbal capriccio–rippling arpeggios of thyme and lavender， of rosemary， basil， myrtle， tarragon； a series of daring modulations through the spice keys into ambergris； and a slow return through sandalwood， camphor， cedar and newmown hay （with occasional subtle touches of discord–a whiff of kidney pudding， the faintest suspicion of pig’s dung） back to the simple aromatics with which the piece began. the final blast of thyme died away； there was a round of applause； the lights went up. in the synthetic music machine the sound-track roll began to unwind. it was a trio for hyper-violin， super-cello and oboe-surrogate that now filled the air with its agreeable languor. thirty or forty bars–and then， against this instrumental background， a much more than human voice began to warble； now throaty， now from the head， now hollow as a flute， now charged with yearning harmonics， it effortlessly passed from gaspard’s forster’s low record on the very frontiers of musical tone to a trilled bat-note high above the highest c to which （in 1770， at the ducal opera of parma， and to the astonishment of mozart） lucrezia ajugari， alone of all the singers in history， once piercingly gave utterance.

　　sunk in their pneumatic stalls， lenina and the savage sniffed and listened. it was now the turn also for eyes and skin.

　　the house lights went down； fiery letters stood out solid and as though self-supported in the darkness. three weeks in a helicopter . an all-super-singing， synthetic-talk1ng， coloured， stereoscopic feely. with synchronized scent-organ accompaniment.

　　“take hold of those metal knobs on the arms of your chair，” whispered lenina. “otherwise you won’t get any of the feely effects.”

　　the savage did as he was told.

　　those fiery letters， meanwhile， had disappeared； there were ten seconds of complete darkness； then suddenly， dazzling and incomparably more solid-looking than they would have seemed in actual flesh and blood， far more real than reality， there stood the stereoscopic images， locked in one another’s arms， of a gigantic negro and a golden-haired young brachycephalic beta-plus female.

　　the savage started. that sensation on his lips！ he lifted a hand to his mouth； the titillation ceased； let his hand fall back on the metal knob； it began again. the scent organ， meanwhile， breathed pure musk. expiringly， a sound-track super-dove cooed “oo-ooh”； and vibrating only thirty-two times a second， a deeper than african bass made answer： “aa-aah.” “ooh-ah！ ooh-ah！” the stereoscopic lips came together again， and once more the facial erogenous zones of the six thousand spectators in the alhambra tingled with almost intolerable galvanic pleasure. “ooh…”

　　the plot of the film was extremely simple. a few minutes after the first oohs and aahs （a duet having been sung and a little love made on that famous bearskin， every hair of which–the assistant predestinator was perfectly right–could be separately and distinctly felt）， the negro had a helicopter accident， fell on his head. thump！ whata twinge through the forehead！ a chorus of ow’s and aie’s went up from the audience.

　　the concussion knocked all the negro’s conditionimg into a cocked hat. he developed for the beta blonde an exclusive and maniacal passion. she protested. he persisted. there were struggles， pursuits， an assault on a rival， finally a sensational kidnapping. the beta blond was ravished away into the sky and kept there， hovering， for three weeks in a wildly anti-social tête-à-tête with the black madman. finally， after a whole series of adventures and much aerial acrobacy three handsome young alphas succeeded in rescuing her. the negro was packed off to an adult re-conditioning centre and the film ended happily and decorously， with the beta blonde becoming the mistress of all her three rescuers. they interrupted themselves for a moment to sing a synthetic quartet， with full super-orchestral accompaniment and gardenias on the scent organ. then the bearskin made a final appearance and， amid a blare of saxophones， the last stereoscopic kiss faded into darkness， the last electric titillation died on the lips like a dying moth that quivers， quivers， ever more feebly， ever more faintly， and at last is quiet， quite still.

　　but for lenina the moth did not completely die. even after the lights had gone up， while they were shuffling slowly along with the crowd towards the lifts， its ghost still fluttered against her lips， still traced fine shuddering roads of anxiety and pleasure across her skin. her cheeks were flushed. she caught hold of the savage’s arm and pressed it， limp， against her side. he looked down at her for a moment， pale， pained， desiring， and ashamed of his desire. he was not worthy， not…their eyes for a moment met. what treasures hers promised！ a queen’s ransom of temperament. hastily he looked away， disengaged his imprisoned arm. he was obscurely terrified lest she should cease to be something he could feel himself unworthy of.

　　“i don’t think you ought to see things like that，” he said， making haste to transfer from lenina herself to the surrounding circumstances the blame for any past or possible future lapse from perfection.

　　“things like what， john？”

　　“like this horrible film.”

　　“horrible？” lenina was genuinely astonished. “but i thought it was lovely.”

　　“it was base，” he said indignantly， “it was ignoble.”

　　she shook her head. “i don’t know what you mean.” why was he so queer？ why did he go out of his way to spoil things？

　　in the taxicopter he hardly even looked at her. bound by strong vows that had never been pronounced， obedient to laws that had long since ceased to run， he sat averted and in silence. sometimes， as though a finger had plucked at some taut， almost breaking string， his whole body would shake with a sudden nervous start.

　　the taxicopter landed on the roof of lenina’s apartment house. “at last，” she thought exultantly as she stepped out of the cab. at last–even though he had been so queer just now. standing under a lamp， she peered into her hand mirror. at last. yes， her nose was a bit shiny. she shook the loose powder from her puff. while he was paying off the taxi–there would just be time. she rubbed at the shininess， thinking： “he’s terribly good-looking. no need for him to be shy like bernard. and yet…any other man would have done it long ago. well， now at last.” that fragment of a face in the little round mirror suddenly smiled at her.

　　“good-night，” said a strangled voice behind her. lenina wheeled round. he was standing in the doorway of the cab， his eyes fixed， staring； had evidently been staring all this time while she was powdering her nose， waiting–but what for？ or hesitating， trying to make up his mind， and all the time thinking， thinking–she could not imagine what extraordinary thoughts. “good-night， lenina，” he repeated， and made a strange grimacing attempt to smile.

　　“but， john…i thought you were…i mean， aren’t you？…”

　　he shut the door and bent forward to say something to the driver. the cab shot up into the air.

　　looking down through the window in the fioor， the savage could see lenina’s upturned face， pale in the bluish light of the lamps. the mouth was open， she was calling. her foreshortened figure rushed away from him； the diminishing square of the roof seemed to be falling through the darkness.

　　five minutes later he was back in his room. from its hiding-place he took out his mouse-nibbled volume， turned with religious care its stained and crumbled pages， and began to read othello. othello， he remembered， was like the hero of three weeks in a helicopter–a black man.

　　drying her eyes， lenina walked across the roof to the lift. on her way down to the twenty-seventh floor she pulled out her soma bottle. one gramme， she decided， would not be enough； hers had been more than a one-gramme affliction. but if she took two grammes， she ran the risk of not waking up in time to-morrow morning. she compromised and， into her cupped left palm， shook out three half-gramme tablets.

第76章 Chapter Twelve(1)


　　bernard had to shout through the locked door； the savage would not open.

　　“but everybody’s there， waiting for you.”

　　“let them wait，” came back the muffled voice through the door.

　　“but you know quite well， john.” （how difficult it is to sound persuasive at the top of one’s voice！） “i asked them on purpose to meet you.”

　　“you ought to have asked me first whether i wanted to meet them.”

　　“but you always came before， john.”

　　“that’s precisely why i don’t want to come again.”

　　“just to please me，” bernard bellowingly wheedled. “won’t you come to please me？”

　　“no.”

　　“do you seriously mean it？”

　　“yes.”

　　despairingly， “but what shall i do？” bernard wailed.

　　“go to hell！” bawled the exasperated voice from within.

　　“but the arch-community-songster of canterbury is there to-night.” bernard was almost in tears.

　　“ai yaa tákwa！” it was only in zu？i that the savage could adequately express what he felt about the arch-community-songster. “háni！” he added as an after-thought； and then （with what derisive ferocity！）： “sons éso tse-ná.” and he spat on the ground， as popé might have done.

　　in the end bernard had to slink back， diminished， to his rooms and inform the impatient assembly that the savage would not be appearing that evening. the news was received with indignation. the men were furious at having been tricked into behaving politely to this insignificant fellow with the unsavoury reputation and the heretical opinions. the higher their position in the hierarchy， the deeper their resentment.

　　“to play such a joke on me，” the arch-songster kept repeating， “on me！”

　　as for the women， they indignantly felt that they had been had on false pretences–had by a wretched little man who had had alcohol poured into his bottle by mistake–by a creature with a gamma-minus physique. it was an outrage， and they said so， more and more loudly. the head mistress of eton was particularly scathing.

　　lenina alone said nothing. pale， her blue eyes clouded with an unwonted melancholy， she sat in a corner， cut off from those who surrounded her by an emotion which they did not share. she had come to the party filled with a strange feeling of anxious exultation. “in a few minutes，” she had said to herself， as she entered the room， “i shall be seeing him， talking to him， telling him” （for she had come with her mind made up） “that i like him–more than anybody i’ve ever known. and then perhaps he’ll say…”

　　what would he say？ the blood had rushed to her cheeks.

　　“why was he so strange the other night， after the feelies？ so queer. and yet i’m absolutely sure he really does rather like me. i’m sure…”

　　it was at this moment that bernard had made his announcement； the savage wasn’t coming to the party.

　　lenina suddenly felt all the sensations normally experienced at the beginning of a violent passion surrogate treatment–a sense of dreadful emptiness， a breathless apprehension， a nausea. her heart seemed to stop beating.

　　“perhaps it’s because he doesn’t like me，” she said to herself. and at once this possibility became an established certainty： john had refused to come because he didn’t like her. he didn’t like her.…

　　“it really is a bit too thick，” the head mistress of eton was saying to the director of crematoria and phosphorus reclamation. “when i think that i actually…”

　　“yes，” came the voice of fanny crowne， “it’s absolutely true about the alcohol. some one i know knew some one who was working in the embryo store at the time. she said to my friend， and my friend said to me…”

　　“too bad， too bad，” said henry foster， sympathizing with the arch-community-songster. “it may interest you to know that our ex-director was on the point of transferring him to iceland.”

　　pierced by every word that was spoken， the tight balloon of bernard’s happy self-confidence was leaking from a thousand wounds. pale， distraught， abject and agitated， he moved among his guests， stammering incoherent apologies， assuring them that next time the savage would certainly be there， begging them to sit down and take a carotene sandwich， a slice of vitamin a p？té， a glass of champagne-surrogate. they duly ate， but ignored him； drank and were either rude to his face or talked to one another about him， loudly and offensively， as though he had not been there.

　　“and now， my friends，” said the arch-community-songster of canterbury， in that beautiful ringing voice with which he led the proceedings at ford’s day celebrations， “now， my friends， i think perhaps the time has come…” he rose， put down his glass， brushed from his purple viscose waistcoat the crumbs of a considerable collation， and walked towards the door.

　　bernard darted forward to intercept him.

　　“must you really， arch-songster？…it’s very early still. i’d hoped you would…”

　　yes， what hadn’t he hoped， when lenina confidentially told him that the arch-community-songster would accept an invitation if it were sent. “he’s really rather sweet， you know.” and she had shown bernard the little golden zipper-fastening in the form of a t which the arch-songster had given her as a memento of the week-end she had spent at lambeth. to meet the arch-community-songster of canterbury and mr. savage. bernard had proclaimed his triumph on every invitation card. but the savage had chosen this evening of all evenings to lock himself up in his room， to shout “háni！” and even （it was lucky that bernard didn’t understand zu？i） “sons éso tse-ná！” what should have been the crowning moment of bernard’s whole career had turned out to be the moment of his greatest humiliation.

　　“i’d so much hoped…” he stammeringly repeated， looking up at the great dignitary with pleading and distracted eyes.

　　“my young friend，” said the arch-community-songster in a tone of loud and solemn severity； there was a general silence. “let me give you a word of advice.” he wagged his finger at bernard. “before it’s too late. a word of good advice.” （his voice became sepulchral.） “mend your ways， my young friend， mend your ways.” he made the sign of the t over him and turned away. “lenina， my dear，” he called in another tone. “come with me.”

　　obediently， but unsmiling and （wholly insensible of the honour done to her） without elation， lenina walked after him， out of the room. the other guests followed at a respectful interval. the last of them slammed the door. bernard was all alone.

第77章 Chapter Twelve(2)


　　punctured， utterly deflated， he dropped into a chair and， covering his face with his hands， began to weep. a few minutes later， however， he thought better of it and took four tablets of soma.

　　upstairs in his room the savage was reading romeo and juliet.

　　lenina and the arch-community-songster stepped out on to the roof of lambeth palace. “hurry up， my young friend–i mean， lenina，” called the arch-songster impatiently from the lift gates. lenina， who had lingered for a moment to look at the moon， dropped her eyes and came hurrying across the roof to rejoin hirn.

　　“a new theory of biology” was the title of the paper which mustapha mond had just finished reading. he sat for some time， meditatively frowning， then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page： “the author’s mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious， but heretical and， so far as the present social order is concerned， dangerous and potentially subversive. not to be published.” he underlined the words. “the author will be kept under supervision. his transference to the marine biological station of st. helena may become necessary.” a pity， he thought， as he signed his name. it was a masterly piece of work. but once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose–well， you didn’t know what the result might be. it was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes–make them lose their faith in happiness as the sovereign good and take to believing， instead， that the goal was somewhere beyond， somewhere outside the present human sphere， that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being， but some intensification and refining of consciousness， some enlargement of knowledge. which was， the controller reflected， quite possibly true. but not， in the present circumstance， admissible. he picked up his pen again， and under the words “not to be published” drew a second line， thicker and blacker than the first； then sighed， “what fun it would be，” he thought， “if one didn’t have to think about happiness！”

　　with closed eyes， his face shining with rapture， john was softly declaiming to vacancy：

　　“oh！ she doth teach the torches to burn bright. it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night， like a rich jewel in an ethiop’s ear； beauty too rich for use， for earth too dear…”

　　the golden t lay shining on lenina’s bosom. sportively， the arch-community-songster caught hold of it， sportively he puled， pulled. “i think，” said lenina suddenly， breaking a long silence， “i’d better take a couple of grammes of soma.”

　　bernard， by this time， was fast asleep and smiling at the private paradise of his dreams. smiling， smiling. but inexorably， every thirty seconds， the minute hand of the electric clock above his bed jumped forward with an almost imperceptible click. click， click， click， click…and it was morning. bernard was back among the miseries of space and time. it was in the lowest spirits that he taxied across to his work at the conditioning centre. the intoxication of success had evaporated； he was soberly his old self； and by contrast with the temporary balloon of these last weeks， the old self seemed unprecedentedly heavier than the surrounding atmosphere.

　　to this deflated bernard the savage showed himself unexpectedly sympathetic.

　　“you’re more like what you were at malpais，” he said， when bernard had told him his plaintive story. “do you remember when we first talked together？ outside the little house. you’re like what you were then.”

　　“because i’m unhappy again； that’s why.”

　　“well， i’d rather be unhappy than have the sort of false， lying happiness you were having here.”

　　“i like that，” said bernard bitterly. “when it’s you who were the cause of it all. refusing to come to my party and so turning them all against me！” he knew that what he was saying was absurd in its injustice； he admitted inwardly， and at last even aloud， the truth of all that the savage now said about the worthlessness of friends who could be turned upon so slight a provocation into persecuting enemies. but in spite of this knowledge and these admissions， in spite of the fact that his friend’s support and sympathy were now his only comfort， bernard continued perversely to nourish， along with his quite genuine affection， a secret grievance against the savage， to mediate a campaign of small revenges to be wreaked upon him. nourishing a grievance against the arch-community-songster was useless； there was no possibility of being revenged on the chief bottler or the assistant predestinator. as a victim， the savage possessed， for bernard， this enormous superiority over the others： that he was accessible. one of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer （in a milder and symbolic form） the punishments that we should like， but are unable， to inflict upon our enemies.

　　bernard’s other victim-friend was helmholtz. when， discomfited， he came and asked once more for the friendship which， in his prosperity， he had not thought it worth his while to preserve. helmholtz gave it； and gave it without a reproach， without a comment， as though he had forgotten that there had ever been a quarrel. touched， bernard felt himself at the same time humiliated by this magnanimity–a magnanimity the more extraordinary and therefore the more humiliating in that it owed nothing to soma and everything to helmholtz’s character. it was the helmholtz of daily life who forgot and forgave， not the helmholtz of a half-gramme holiday. bernard was duly grateful （it was an enormous comfort to have his friend again） and also duly reseritful （it would be pleasure to take some revenge on helmholtz for his generosity）.

　　at their first meeting after the estrangement， bernard poured out the tale of his miseries and accepted consolation. it was not till some days later that he learned， to his surprise and with a twinge of shame， that he was not the only one who had been in trouble. helmholtz had also come into conflict with authority.

第78章 Chapter Twelve(3)


　　“it was over some rhymes，” he explained. “i was giving my usual course of advanced emotional engineering for third year students. twelve lectures， of which the seventh is about rhymes. ’on the use of rhymes in moral propaganda and advertisement，’ to be precise. i always illustrate my lecture with a lot of technical examples. this time i thought i’d give them one i’d just written myself. pure madness， of course； but i couldn’t resist it.” he laughed. “i was curious to see what their reactions would be. besides，” he added more gravely， “i wanted to do a bit of propaganda； i was trying to engineer them into feeling as i’d felt when i wrote the rhymes. ford！” he laughed again. “what an outcry there was！ the principal had me up and threatened to hand me the immediate sack. l’m a marked man.”

　　“but what were your rhymes？” bernard asked.

　　“they were about being alone.”

　　bernard’s eyebrows went up.

　　“i’ll recite them to you， if you like.” and helmholtz began：

　　“yesterday’s committee， sticks， but a broken drum， midnight in the city， flutes in a vacuum， shut lips， sleeping faces， every stopped machine， the dumb and littered places where crowds have been：…all silences rejoice， weep （loudly or low）， speak–but with the voice of whom， i do not know. absence， say， of susan’s， absenee of egeria’s arms and respective bosoms， lips and， ah， posteriors， slowly form a presence； whose？ and， i ask， of what so absurd an essence， that something， which is not， nevertheless should populate empty night more solidly than that with which we copulate， why should it seem so squalidly？

　　well， i gave them that as an example， and they reported me to the principal.”

　　“i’m not surprised，” said bernard. “it’s flatly against all their sleep-teaching. remember， they’ve had at least a quarter of a million warnings against solitude.”

　　“i know. but i thought i’d like to see what the effect would be.”

　　“well， you’ve seen now.”

　　helmholtz only laughed. “i feel，” he said， after a silence， “as though i were just beginning to have something to write about. as though i were beginning to be able to use that power i feel i’ve got inside me–that extra， latent power. something seems to be coming to me.” in spite of all his troubles， he seemed， bernard thought， profoundly happy.

　　helmholtz and the savage took to one another at once. so cordially indeed that bernard felt a sharp pang of jealousy. in all these weeks he had never come to so close an intimacy with the savage as helmholtz immediately achieved. watching them， listening to their talk， he found himself sometimes resentfully wishing that he had never brought them together. he was ashamed of his jealousy and alternately made efforts of will and took soma to keep himself from feeling it. but the efforts were not very successful； and between the soma-holidays there were， of necessity， intervals. the odius sentiment kept on returning.

　　at his third meeting with the savage， helmholtz recited his rhymes on solitude.

　　“what do you think of them？” he asked when he had done.

　　the savage shook his head. “listen to this，” was his answer； and unlocking the drawer in which he kept his mouse-eaten book， he opened and read：

　　“let the bird of loudest lay on the sole arabian tree， herald sad and trumpet be…”

　　helmholtz listened with a growing excitement. at “sole arabian tree” he started； at “thou shrieking harbinger” he smiled with sudden pleasure； at “every fowl of tyrant wing” the blood rushed up into his cheeks； but at “defunctive music” he turned pale and trembled with an unprecedented emotion. the savage read on：

　　“property was thus appall’d， that the self was not the same； single nature’s double name neither two nor one was call’d reason in itself confounded saw division grow together…”

第79章 Chapter Twelve(4)


　　“orgy-porgy！” said bernard， interrupting the reading with a loud， unpleasant laugh. “it’s just a solidarity service hymn.” he was revenging himself on his two friends for liking one another more than they liked him.

　　in the course of their next two or three meetings he frequently repeated this little act of vengeance. it was simple and， since both helmholtz and the savage were dreadfully pained by the shattering and defilement of a favourite poetic crystal， extremely effective. in the end， helmholtz threatened to kick him out of the room if he dared to interrupt again. and yet， strangely enough， the next interruption， the most disgraceful of all， came from helmholtz himself.

　　the savage was reading romeo and juliet aloud–reading （for all the time he was seeing himself as romeo and lenina as juliet） with an intense and quivering passion. helmholtz had listened to the scene of the lovers’ first meeting with a puzzled interest. the scene in the orchard had delighted him with its poetry； but the sentiments expressed had made him smile. getting into such a state about having a girl–it seemed rather ridiculous. but， taken detail by verbal detail， what a superb piece of emotional engineering！ “that old fellow，” he said， “he makes our best propaganda technicians look absolutely silly.” the savage smiled triumphantly and resumed his reading. all went tolerably well until， in the last scene of the third act， capulet and lady capulet began to bully juliet to marry paris. helmholtz had been restless throughout the entire scene； but when， pathetically mimed by the savage， juliet cried out：

　　“is there no pity sitting in the clouds， that sees into the bottom of my grief？ o sweet my mother， cast me not away： delay this marriage for a month， a week； or， if you do not， make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies…”

　　when juliet said this， helmholtz broke out in an explosion of uncontrollable guffawing.

　　the mother and father （grotesque obscenity） forcing the daughter to have some one she didn’t want！ and the idiotic girl not saying that she was having some one else whom （for the moment， at any rate） she preferred！ in its smutty absurdity the situation was irresistibly comical. he had managed， with a heroic effort， to hold down the mounting pressure of his hilarity； but “sweet mother” （in the savage’s tremulous tone of anguish） and the reference to tybalt lying dead， but evidently uncremated and wasting his phosphorus on a dim monument， were too much for him. he laughed and laughed till the tears streamed down his face–quenchlessly laughed while， pale with a sense of outrage， the savage looked at him over the top of his book and then， as the laughter still continued， closed it indignantly， got up and， with the gesture of one who removes his pearl from before swine， locked it away in its drawer.

　　“and yet，” said helmholtz when， having recovered breath enough to apologize， he had mollified the savage into listening to his explanations， “i know quite well that one needs ridiculous， mad situations like that； one can’t write really well about anything else. why was that old fellow such a marvellous propaganda technician？ because he had so many insane， excruciating things to get excited about. you’ve got to be hurt and upset； otherwise you can’t think of the really good， penetrating， x-rayish phrases. but fathers and mothers！” he shook his head. “you can’t expect me to keep a straight face about fathers and mothers. and who’s going to get excited about a boy having a girl or not having her？” （the savage winced； but helmholtz， who was staring pensively at the floor， saw nothing.） “no.” he concluded， with a sigh， “it won’t do. we need some other kind of madness and violence. but what？ what？ where can one find it？” he was silent； then， shaking his head， “i don’t know，” he said at last， “i don’t know.”

第80章 Chapter Thirteen(1)


　　henry foster loomed up through the twilight of the embryo store.

　　“like to come to a feely this evening？”

　　lenina shook her head without speaking.

　　“going out with some one else？” it interested him to know which of his friends was being had by which other. “is it benito？” he questioned.

　　she shook her head again.

　　henry detected the weariness in those purple eyes， the pallor beneath that glaze of lupus， the sadness at the corners of the unsmiling crimson mouth. “you’re not feeling ill， are you？” he asked， a trifle anxiously， afraid that she might be suffering from one of the few remaining infectious diseases.

　　yet once more lenina shook her head.

　　“anyhow， you ought to go and see the doctor，” said henry. “a doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away，” he added heartily， driving home his hypnop？dic adage with a clap on the shoulder. “perhaps you need a pregnancy substitute，” he suggested. “or else an extra-strong v.p.s. treatment. sometimes， you know， the standard passion surrogate isn’t quite…”

　　“oh， for ford’s sake，” said lenina， breaking her stubborn silence， “shut up！” and she turned back to her neglected embryos.

　　a v.p.s. treatment indeed！ she would have laughed， if she hadn’t been on the point of crying. as though she hadn’t got enough v. p. of her own！ she sighed profoundly as she refilled her syringe. “john，” she murmured to herself， “john…” then “my ford，” she wondered， “have i given this one its sleeping sickness injection， or haven’t i？” she simply couldn’t remember. in the end， she decided not to run the risk of letting it have a second dose， and moved down the line to the next bottle.

　　twenty-two years， eight months， and four days from that moment， a promising young alpha-minus administrator at mwanza-mwanza was to die of trypanosomiasis–the first case for over half a century. sighing， lenina went on with her work.

　　an hour later， in the changing room， fanny was energetically protesting. “but it’s absurd to let yourself get into a state like this. simply absurd，” she repeated. “and what about？ a man–one man.”

　　“but he’s the one i want.”

　　“as though there weren’t millions of other men in the world.”

　　“but i don’t want them.”

　　“how can you know till you’ve tried？”

　　“i have tried.”

　　“but how many？” asked fanny， shrugging her shoulders contemptuously. “one， two？”

　　“dozens. but，” shaking her head， “it wasn’t any good，” she added.

　　“well， you must persevere，” said fanny sententiously. but it was obvious that her confidence in her own prescriptions had been shaken. “nothing can be achieved without perseverance.”

　　“but meanwhile…”

　　“don’t think of him.”

　　“i can’t help it.”

　　“take soma， then.”

　　“i do.”

　　“well， go on.”

　　“but in the intervals i still like him. i shall always like him.”

　　“well， if that’s the case，” said fanny， with decision， “why don’t you just go and take him. whether he wants it or no.”

　　“but if you knew how terribly queer he was！”

　　“all the more reason for taking a firm line.”

　　“it’s all very well to say that.”

　　“don’t stand any nonsense. act.” fanny’s voice was a trumpet； she might have been a y.w.f.a. lecturer giving an evening talk to adolescent beta-minuses. “yes， act–at once. do it now.”

　　“i’d be scared，” said lenina

　　“well， you’ve only got to take half a gramme of soma first. and now i’m going to have my bath.” she marched off， trailing her towel.

　　the bell rang， and the savage， who was impatiently hoping that helmholtz would come that afternoon （for having at last made up his mind to talk to helmholtz about lenina， he could not bear to postpone his confidences a moment longer）， jumped up and ran to the door.

　　“i had a premonition it was you， helmholtz，” he shouted as he opened.

　　on the threshold， in a white acetate-satin sailor suit，and with a round white cap rakishly tilted over her left ear， stood lenina.

　　“oh！” said the savage， as though some one had struck him a heavy blow.

　　half a gramme had been enough to make lenina forget her fears and her embarrassments. “hullo， john，” she said， smiling， and walked past him into the room. automatically he closed the door and followed her. lenina sat down. there was a long silence.

　　“you don’t seem very glad to see me， john，” she said at last.

　　“not glad？” the savage looked at her reproachfully； then suddenly fell on his knees before her and， taking lenina’s hand， reverently kissed it. “not glad？ oh， if you only knew，” he whispered and， venturing to raise his eyes to her face， “admired lenina，” he went on， “indeed the top of admiration， worth what’s dearest in the world.” she smiled at him with a luscious tenderness. “oh， you so perfect” （she was leaning towards him with parted lips）， “so perfect and so peerless are created” （nearer and nearer） “of every creature’s best.” still nearer. the savage suddenly scrambled to his feet. “that’s why，” he said speaking with averted face， “i wanted to do something first…i mean， to show i was worthy of you. not that i could ever really be that. but at any rate to show i wasn’t absolutely un-worthy. i wanted to do something.”

　　“why should you think it necessary…” lenina began， but left the sentence unfinished. there was a note of irritation in her voice. when one has leant forward， nearer and nearer， with parted lips–only to find oneself， quite suddenly， as a clumsy oaf scrambles to his feet， leaning towards nothing at all–well， there is a reason， even with half a gramme of soma circulating in one’s blood-stream， a genuine reason for annoyance.

　　“at malpais，” the savage was incoherently mumbling， “you had to bring her the skin of a mountain lion–i mean， when you wanted to marry some one. or else a wolf.”

　　“there aren’t any lions in england，” lenina almost snapped.

　　“and even if there were，” the savage added， with sudden contemptuous resentment， “people would kill them out of helicopters， i suppose， with poison gas or something. i wouldn’t do that， lenina.” he squared his shoulders， he ventured to look at her and was met with a stare of annoyed incomprehension. confused， “i’ll do anything，” he went on， more and more incoherently. “anything you tell me. there be some sports are painful–you know. but their labour delight in them sets off. that’s what i feel. i mean i’d sweep the floor if you wanted.”

　　“but we’ve got vacuum cleaners here，” said lenina in bewilderment. “it isn’t necessary.”

　　“no， of course it isn’t necessary. but some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone. i’d like to undergo something nobly. don’t you see？”

　　“but if there are vacuum cleaners…”

　　“that’s not the point.”

　　“and epsilon semi-morons to work them，” she went on， “well， really， why？”

　　“why？ but for you， for you. just to show that i…”

第81章 Chapter Thirteen(2)


　　“and what on earth vacuum cleaners have got to do with lions…”

　　“to show how much…”

　　“or lions with being glad to see me…” she was getting more and more exasperated.

　　“how much i love you， lenina，” he brought out almost desperately.

　　an emblem of the inner tide of startled elation， the blood rushed up into lenina’s cheeks. “do you mean it， john？”

　　“but i hadn’t meant to say so，” cried the savage， clasping his hands in a kind of agony. “not until…listen， lenina； in malpais people get married.”

　　“get what？” the irritation had begun to creep back into her voice. what was he talking about now？

　　“for always. they make a promise to live together for always.”

　　“what a horrible idea！” lenina was genuinely shocked.

　　“outliving beauty’s outward with a mind that cloth renew swifter than blood decays.”

　　“what？”

　　“it’s like that in shakespeare too. ‘if thou cost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite…’”

　　“for ford’s sake， john， talk sense. i can’t understand a word you say. first it’s vacuum cleaners； then it’s knots. you’re driving me crazy.” she jumped up and， as though afraid that he might run away from her physically， as well as with his mind， caught him by the wrist. “answer me this question： do you really like me， or don’t you？”

　　there was a moment’s silence； then， in a very low voice， “i love you more than anything in the world，” he said.

　　“then why on earth didn’t you say so？” she cried， and so intense was her exasperation that she drove her sharp nails into the skin of his wrist. “instead of drivelling away about knots and vacuum cleaners and lions， and making me miserable for weeks and weeks.”

　　she released his hand and flung it angrily away from her.

　　“if i didn’t like you so much，” she said， “i’d be furious with you.”

　　and suddenly her arms were round his neck； he felt her lips soft against his own. so deliciously soft， so warm and electric that inevitably he found himself thinking of the embraces in three weeks in a helicopter. ooh！ ooh！ the stereoscopic blonde and anh！ the more than real black-amoor. horror， horror， horror…he fired to disengage himself； but lenina tightened her embrace.

　　“why didn’t you say so？” she whispered， drawing back her face to look at him. her eyes were tenderly reproachful.

　　“the murkiest den， the most opportune place” （the voice of conscience thundered poetically）， “the strongest suggestion our worser genius can， shall never melt mine honour into lust. never， never！” he resolved.

　　“you silly boy！” she was saying. “i wanted you so much. and if you wanted me too， why didn’t you？…”

　　“but， lenina…” he began protesting； and as she immediately untwined her arms， as she stepped away from him， he thought， for a moment， that she had taken his unspoken hint. but when she unbuckled her white patent cartridge belt and hung it carefully over the back of a chair， he began to suspect that he had been mistaken.

　　“lenina！” he repeated apprehensively.

　　she put her hand to her neck and gave a long vertical pull； her white sailor’s blouse was ripped to the hem； suspicion condensed into a too， too solid certainty. “lenina， what are you doing？”

　　zip， zip！ her answer was wordless. she stepped out of her bell-bottomed trousers. her zippicamiknicks were a pale shell pink. the arch-community-songster’s golden t dangled at her breast.

　　“for those milk paps that through the window bars bore at men’s eyes....” the singing， thundering， magical words made her seem doubly dangerous， doubly alluring. soft， soft， but how piercing！ boring and drilling into reason， tunnelling through resolution. “the strongest oaths are straw to the fire i’ the blood. be more abstemious， or else…”

　　zip！ the rounded pinkness fell apart like a neatly divided apple. a wriggle of the arms， a lifting first of the right foot， then the left： the zippicamiknicks were lying lifeless and as though deflated on the floor.

　　still wearing her shoes and socks， and her rakishly tilted round white cap， she advanced towards him. “darling. darling！ if only you’d said so before！” she held out her arms.

　　but instead of also saying “darling！” and holding out his arms， the savage retreated in terror， flapping his hands at her as though he were trying to scare away some intruding and dangerous animal. four backwards steps， and he was brought to bay against the wall.

　　“sweet！” said lenina and， laying her hands on his shoulders， pressed herself against him. “put your arms round me，” she commanded. “hug me till you drug me， honey.” she too had poetry at her command， knew words that sang and were spells and beat drums. “kiss me”； she closed her eyes， she let her voice sink to a sleepy murmur， “kiss me till i’m in a coma. hug me， honey， snuggly…”

　　the savage caught her by the wrists， tore her hands from his shoulders， thrust her roughly away at arm’s length.

　　“ow， you’re hurting me， you’re…oh！” she was suddenly silent. terror had made her forget the pain. opening her eyes， she had seen his face–no， not his face， a ferocious stranger’s， pale， distorted， twitching with some insane， inexplicable fury. aghast， “but what is it， john？” she whispered. he did not answer， but only stared into her face with those mad eyes. the hands that held her wrists were trembling. he breathed deeply and irregularly. faint almost to imperceptibility， but appalling， she suddenly heard the gneding of his teeth. “what is it？” she almost screamed.

　　and as though awakened by her cry he caught her by the shoulders and shook her. “whore！” he shouted “whore！ impudent strumpet！”

　　“oh， don’t， do-on’t，” she protested in a voice made grotesquely tremulous by his shaking.

　　“whore！”

　　“plea-ease.”

　　“damned whore！”

　　“a gra-amme is be-etter…” she began.

　　the savage pushed her away with such force that she staggered and fell. “go，” he shouted， standing over her menacingly， “get out of my sight or i’ll kill you.” he clenched his fists.

　　lenina raised her arm to cover her face. “no， please don’t， john…”

　　“hurry up. quick！”

　　one arm still raised， and following his every movement with a terrified eye， she scrambled to her feet and still crouching， still covering her head， made a dash for the bathroom.

　　the noise of that prodigious slap by which her departure was accelerated was like a pistol shot.

　　“ow！” lenina bounded forward.

　　safely locked into the bathroom， she had leisure to take stock of her injuries. standing with her back to the mirror， she twisted her head. looking over her left shoulder she could see the imprint of an open hand standing out distinct and crimson on the pearly flesh. gingerly she rubbed the wounded spot.

　　outside， in the other room， the savage was striding up and down， marching， marching to the drums and music of magical words. “the wren goes to’t and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight.” maddeningly they rumbled in his ears. “the fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t with a more riotous appetite. down from the waist they are centaurs， though women all above. but to the girdle do the gods inherit. beneath is all the fiend’s. there’s hell， there’s darkness， there is the sulphurous pit， burning scalding， stench， consumption； fie， fie， fie， pain， pain！ give me an ounce of civet， good apothecary， to sweeten my imagination.”

　　“john！” ventured a small ingratiating voice from the bathroom. “john！”

　　“o thou weed， who are so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet that the sense aches at thee. was this most goodly book made to write ‘whore’ upon？ heaven stops the nose at it…”

　　but her perfume still hung about him， his jacket was white with the powder that had scented her velvety body. “impudent strumpet， impudent strumpet， impudent strumpet.” the inexorable rhythm beat itself out. “impudent…”

　　“john， do you think i might have my clothes？”

　　he picked up the bell-bottomed trousers， the blouse， the zippicamiknicks.

　　“open！” he ordered， kicking the door.

　　“no， i won’t.” the voice was frightened and defiant.

　　“well， how do you expect me to give them to you？”

　　“push them through the ventilator over the door.”

　　he did what she suggested and returned to his uneasy pacing of the room. “impudent strumpet， impudent strumpet. the devil luxury with his fat rump and potato finger…”

　　“john.”

　　he would not answer. “fat rump and potato finger.”

　　“john.”

　　“what is it？” he asked gruffly.

　　“i wonder if you’d mind giving me my malthusian belt.” lenina sat， listening to the footsteps in the other room， wondering， as she listened， how long he was likely to go tramping up and down like that； whether she would have to wait until he left the flat； or if it would be safe， after allowing his madness a reasonable time to subside， to open the bathroom door and make a dash for it.

　　she was interrupted in the midst of these uneasy speculations by the sound of the telephone bell ringing in the other room. abruptly the tramping ceased. she heard the voice of the savage parleying with silence.

　　“hullo.”

　　…

　　“yes.”

　　…

　　“if i do not usurp myself， i am.”

　　…

　　“yes， didn’t you hear me say so？ mr. savage speaking.”

　　…

　　“what？ who’s ill？ of course it interests me.”

　　…

　　“but is it serious？ is she really bad？ i’ll go at once…”

　　…

　　“not in her rooms any more？ where has she been taken？”

　　…

　　“oh， my god！ what’s the address？”

　　…

　　“three park lane–is that it？ three？ thanks.”

　　lenina heard the click of the replaced receiver， then hurrying steps. a door slammed. there was silence. was he really gone？

　　with an infinity of precautions she opened the door a quarter of an inch； peeped through the crack； was encouraged by the view of emptiness； opened a little further， and put her whole head out； finally tiptoed into the room； stood for a few seconds with strongly beating heart， listening， listening； then darted to the front door， opened， slipped through， slammed， ran. it was not till she was in the lift and actually dropping down the well that she began to feel herself secure.

第83章 Chapter Fourteen(1)


　　the park lane hospital for the dying was a sixty-story tower of primrose tiles. as the savage stepped out of his taxicopter a convoy of gaily-coloured aerial hearses rose whirring from the roof and darted away across the park， westwards， bound for the slough crematorium. at the lift gates the presiding porter gave him the information he required， and he dropped down to ward 81 （a galloping senility ward， the porter explained） on the seventeenth floor.

　　it was a large room bright with sunshine and yellow paint， and containing twenty beds， all occupied. linda was dying in company–in company and with all the modern conveniences. the air was continuously alive with gay synthetic melodies. at the foot of every bed， confronting its moribund occupant， was a television box. television was left on， a running tap， from morning till night. every quarter of an hour the prevailing perfume of the room was automatically changed. “we try，” explained the nurse， who had taken charge of the savage at the door， “we try to create a thoroughly pleasant atmosphere here–something between a first-class hotel and a feely-palace， if you take my meaning.”

　　“where is she？” asked the savage， ignoring these polite explanations.

　　the nurse was offended. “you are in a hurry，” she said.

　　“is there any hope？” he asked.

　　“you mean， of her not dying？” （he nodded.） “no， of course there isn’t. when somebody’s sent here， there’s no…” startled by the expression of distress on his pale face， she suddenly broke off. “why， whatever is the matter？” she asked. she was not accustomed to this kind of thing in visitors. （not that there were many visitors anyhow： or any reason why there should be many visitors.） “you’re not feeling ill， are you？”

　　he shook his head. “she’s my mother，” he said in a scarcely audible voice.

　　the nurse glanced at him with startled， horrified eyes； then quickly looked away. from throat to temple she was all one hot blush.

　　“take me to her，” said the savage， making an effort to speak in an ordinary tone.

　　still blushing， she led the way down the ward. faces still fresh and unwithered （for senility galloped so hard that it had no time to age the cheeks–only the heart and brain） turned as they passed. their progress was followed by the blank， incurious eyes of second infancy. the savage shuddered as he looked.

　　linda was lying in the last of the long row of beds， next to the wall. propped up on pillows， she was watching the semi-finals of the south american riemann-surface tennis championship， which were being played in silent and diminished reproduction on the screen of the television box at the foot of the bed. hither and thither across their square of illuminted glass the little figures noiselessly darted， like fish in an aquarium–the silent but agitated inhabitants of another world.

　　linda looked on， vaguely and uncomprehendingly smiling. her pale， bloated face wore an expression of imbecile happiness. every now and then her eyelids closed， and for a few seconds she seemed to be dozing. then with a little start she would wake up again–wake up to the aquarium antics of the tennis champions， to the super-vox-wurlitzeriana rendering of “hug me till you drug me， honey，” to the warm draught of verbena that came blowing through the ventilator above her head–would wake to these things， or rather to a dream of which these things， transformed and embellished by the soma in her blood， were the marvellous constituents， and smile once more her broken and discoloured smile of infantile contentment.

　　“well， i must go，” said the nurse. “i’ve got my batch of children coming. besides， there’s number 3.” she pointed up the ward. “might go off any minute now. well， make yourself comfortable.” she walked briskly away.

　　the savage sat down beside the bed.

　　“linda，” he whispered， taking her hand.

　　at the sound of her name， she turned. her vague eyes brightened with recognition. she squeezed his hand， she smiled， her lips moved； then quite suddenly her head fell forward. she was asleep. he sat watching her–seeking through the tired flesh， seeking and finding that young， bright face which had stooped over his childhood in malpais， remembering （and he closed his eyes） her voice， her movements， all the events of their life together. “streptocock-gee to banbury t…” how beautiful her singing had been！ and those childish rhymes， how magically strange and mysterious！

　　a， b， c， vitamin d： the fat’s in the liver， the cod’s in the sea.

　　he felt the hot tears welling up behind his eyelids as he recalled the words and linda’s voice as she repeated them. and then the reading lessons： the tot is in the pot， the cat is on the mat； and the elementary instructions for beta workers in the embryo store. and long evenings by the fire or， in summertime， on the roof of the little house， when she told him those stories about the other place， outside the reservation： that beautiful， beautiful other place， whose memory， as of a heaven， a paradise of goodness and loveliness， he still kept whole and intact， undefiled by contact with the reality of this real london， these actual civilized men and women.

　　a sudden noise of shrill voices made him open his eyes and， after hastily brushing away the tears， look round. what seemed an interminable stream of identical eight-year-old male twins was pouring into the room. twin after twin， twin after twin， they came–a nightmare. their faces， their repeated face–for there was only one between the lot of them–puggishly stared， all nostrils and pale goggling eyes. their uniform was khaki. all their mouths hung open. squealing and chattering they entered. in a moment， it seemed， the ward was maggoty with them. they swarmed between the beds， clambered over， crawled under， peeped into the television boxes， made faces at the patients.

　　linda astonished and rather alarmed them. a group stood clustered at the foot of her bed， staring with the frightened and stupid curiosity of animals suddenly confronted by the unknown.

　　“oh， look， look！” they spoke in low， scared voices. “whatever is the matter with her？ why is she so fat？”

第84章 Chapter Fourteen(2)


　　they had never seen a face like hers before–had never seen a face that was not youthful and taut-skinned， a body that had ceased to be slim and upright. all these moribund sexagenarians had the appearance of childish girls. at forty-four， linda seemed， by contrast， a monster of flaccid and distorted senility.

　　“isn’t she awful？” came the whispered comments. “look at her teeth！”

　　suddenly from under the bed a pug-faced twin popped up between john’s chair and the wall， and began peering into linda’s sleeping face.

　　“i say…” he began； but the sentence ended prematurely in a squeal. the savage had seized him by the collar， lifted him clear over the chair and， with a smart box on the ears， sent him howling away.

　　his yells brought the head nurse hurrying to the rescue.

　　“what have you been doing to him？” she demanded fiercely. “i won’t have you striking the children.”

　　“well then， keep them away from this bed.” the savage’s voice was trembling with indigation. “what are these filthy little brats doing here at all？ it’s disgraceful！”

　　“disgraceful？ but what do you mean？ they’re being death-conditioned. and i tell you，” she warned him truculently， “if i have any more of your interference with their conditioning， i’ll send for the porters and have you thrown out.”

　　the savage rose to his feet and took a couple of steps towards her. his movements and the expression on his face were so menacing that the nurse fell back in terror. with a great effort he checked himself and， without speaking， turned away and sat down again by the bed.

　　reassured， but with a dignity that was a trifle shrill and uncertain， “i’ve warned you，” said the nurse， “i’ve warned you，” said the nurse， “so mind.” still， she led the too inquisitive twins away and made them join in the game of hunt-the-zipper， which had been organized by one of her colleagues at the other end of the room.

　　“run along now and have your cup of caffeine solution， dear，” she said to the other nurse. the exercise of authority restored her confidence， made her feel better. “now children！” she called.

　　linda had stirred uneasily， had opened her eyes for a moment， looked vaguely around， and then once more dropped off to sleep. sitting beside her， the savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes before. “a， b， c， vitamin d，” he repeated to himself， as though the words were a spell that would restore the dead past to life. but the spell was ineffective. obstinately the beautiful memories refused to rise； there was only a hateful resurrection of jealousies and uglinesses and miseries. popé with the blood trickling down from his cut shoulder； and linda hideously asleep， and the flies buzzing round the spilt mescal on the floor beside the bed； and the boys calling those names as she passed.…ah， no， no！ he shut his eyes， he shook his head in strenuous denial of these memories. “a， b， c， vitamin d…” he tried to think of those times when he sat on her knees and she put her arms about him and sang， over and over again， rocking him， rocking him to sleep. “a， b， c， vitamin d， vitamin d， vitamin d…”

　　the super-vox-wurlitzeriana had risen to a sobbing crescendo； and suddenly the verbena gave place， in the scent-circulating system， to an intense patchouli. linda stirred， woke up， stared for a few seconds bewilderly at the semi-finalists， then， lifting her face， sniffed once or twice at the newly perfumed air and suddenly smiled–a smile of childish ectasy.

　　“popé！” she murmured， and closed her eyes. “oh， i do so like it， i do…” she sighed and let herself sink back into the pillows.

　　“but， linda！” the savage spoke imploringly， “don’t you know me？” he had tried so hard， had done his very best； why woudn’t she allow him to forget？ he squeezed her limp hand almost with violence， as though he would force her to come back from this dream of ignoble pleasures， from these base and hateful memories–back into the present， back into reality： the appalling present， the awful reality–but sublime， but significant， but desperately important precisely because of the immience of that which made them so fearful. “don’t you know me， linda？”

　　he felt the faint answering pressure of her hand. the tears started into his eyes. he bent over her and kissed her.

　　her lips moved. “popé！” she whispered again， and it was as though he had had a pailful of ordure thrown in his face.

　　anger suddenly boiled up in him. balked for the second time， the passion of his grief had found another outlet， was transformed into a passion of agonized rage.

　　“but i’m john！” he shouted. “i’m john！” and in his furious misery he actually caught her by the shouder and shook her.

第85章 Chapter Fourteen(3)


　　linda’s eyes fluttered open； she saw him， knew him–“john！”–but situated the real face， the real and violent hands， in an imaginary world–among the inward and private equivalents of patchouli and the super-wurlitzer， among the transfigured memories and the strangely transposed sensations that constituted the universe of her dream. she knew him for john， her son， but fancied him an intruder into that paradisal malpais where she had been spending her soma-holiday with popé. he was angry because she liked popé， he was shaking her because popé was there in the bed–as though there were something wrong， as though all civilized people didn’t do the same. “every one belongs to every…” her voice suddenly died into an almost inaudible breathless croaking. her mouth fell open： she made a desperate effort to fill her lungs with air. but it was as though she had forgotten how to breathe. she tried to cry out–but no sound came； only the terror of her staring eyes revealed what she was suffering. her hands went to her throat， then clawed at the air–the air she coud no longer breathe， the air that， for her， had ceased to exist.

　　the savage was on his feet， bent over her. “what is it， linda？ what is it？” his voice was imploring； it was as though he were begging to be reassured.

　　the look she gave him was charged with an unspeakable terror–with terror and， it seemed to him， reproach.

　　she tried to raise herself in bed， but fell back on to the pillows. her face was horribly distorted， her lips blue.

　　the savage turned and ran up the ward.

　　“quick， quick！” he shouted. “quick！”

　　standing in the centre of a ring of zipper-hunting twins， the head nurse looked round. the first moment’s astonishment gave place almost instantly to disapproval. “don’t shout！ think of the little ones，” she said， frowning. “you might decondition…but what are you doing？” he had broken through the ring. “be careful！” a child was yelling.

　　“quick， quick！” he caught her by the sleeve， dragged her after him. “quick！ something’s happened. i’ve killed her.”

　　by the time they were back at the end of the ward linda was dead.

　　the savage stood for a moment in frozen silence， then fell on his knees beside the bed and， covering his face with his hands， sobbed uncontrollably.

　　the nurse stood irresolute， looking now at the kneeling figure by the bed （the scandalous exhibition！） and now （poor children！） at the twins who had stopped their hunting of the zipper and were staring from the other end of the ward， staring with all their eyes and nostrils at the shocking scene that was being enacted round bed 20. should she speak to him？ try to bring him back to a sense of decency？ remind him of where he was？ of what fatal mischief he might do to these poor innocents？ undoing all their wholesome death-conditioning with this disgusting outcry–as though death were something terrible， as though any one mattered as much as all that！ it might give them the most disastrous ideas about the subject， might upset them into reacting in the entirely wrong， the utterly anti-social way.

　　she stepped forward， she touched him on the shoulder. “can’t you behave？” she said in a low， angry voice. but， looking around， she saw that half a dozen twins were already on their feet and advancing down the ward. the circle was distintegrating. in another moment…no， the risk was too great； the whole group might be put back six or seven months in its conditioning. she hurried back towards her menaced charges.

　　“now， who wants a chocolate éclair？” she asked in a loud， cheerful tone.

　　“me！” yelled the entire bokanovsky group in chorus. bed 20 was completely forgotten.

　　“oh， god， god， god…” the savage kept repeating to himself. in the chaos of grief and remorse that filled his mind it was the one articulate word. “god！” he whispered it aloud. “god…”

　　“whatever is he saying？” said a voice， very near， distinct and shrill through the warblings of the super-wurlitzer.

　　the savage violently started and， uncovering his face， looked round. five khaki twins， each with the stump of a long éclair in his right hand， and their identical faces variously smeared with liquid chocolate， were standing in a row， puggily goggling at him.

　　they met his eyes and simultaneously grinned. one of them pointed with his éclair butt.

　　“is she dead？” he asked.

　　the savage stared at them for a moment in silence. then in silence he rose to his feet， in silence slowly walked towards the door.

　　“is she dead？” repeated the inquisitive twin trotting at his side.

　　the savage looked down at him and still without speaking pushed him away. the twin fell on the floor and at once began to howl. the savage did not even look round.

第86章 Chapter Fifteen(1)


　　the menial staff of the park lane hospital for the dying consisted of one hundred and sixty-two deltas divided into two bokanovsky groups of eighty-four red headed female and seventy-eight dark dolychocephalic male twins， respectively. at six， when their working day was over， the two groups assembled in the vestibule of the hospital and were served by the deputy sub-bursar with their soma ration.

　　from the lift the savage stepped out into the midst of them. but his mind was elsewhere–with death， with his grief， and his remorse； mechanicaly， without consciousness of what he was doing， he began to shoulder his way through the crowd.

　　“who are you pushing？ where do you think you’re going？”

　　high， low， from a multitude of separate throats， only two voices squeaked or growled. repeated indefinitely， as though by a train of mirrors， two faces， one a hairless and freckled moon haloed in orange， the other a thin， beaked bird-mask， stubbly with two days’ beard， turned angrily towards him. their words and， in his ribs， the sharp nudging of elbows， broke through his unawareness. he woke once more to external reality， looked round him， knew what he saw–knew it， with a sinking sense of horror and disgust， for the recurrent delirium of his days and nights， the nightmare of swarming indistinguishable sameness. twins， twins.…like maggots they had swarmed defilingly over the mystery of linda’s death. maggots again， but larger， full grown， they now crawled across his grief and his repentance. he halted and， with bewildered and horrified eyes， stared round him at the khaki mob， in the midst of which， overtopping it by a full head， he stood. “how many goodly creatures are there here！” the singing words mocked him derisively. “how beauteous mankind is！ o brave new world…”

　　“soma distribution！” shouted a loud voice. “in good order， please. hurry up there.”

　　a door had been opened， a table and chair carried into the vestibule. the voice was that of a jaunty young alpha， who had entered carrying a black iron cash-box. a murmur of satisfaction went up from the expectant twins. they forgot all about the savage. their attention was now focused on the black cash-box， which the young man had placed on the table， and was now in process of unlocking. the lid was lifted.

　　“oo-oh！” said all the hundred and sixty-two simultaneously， as though they were looking at fireworks.

　　the young man took out a handful of tiny pill-boxes. “now，” he said peremptorily， “step forward， please. one at a time， and no shoving.”

　　one at a time， with no shoving， the twins stepped forward. first two males， then a female， then another male， then three females， then…

　　the savage stood looking on. “o brave new world， o brave new world…” in his mind the singing words seemed to change their tone. they had mocked him through his misery and remorse， mocked him with how hideous a note of cynical derision！ fiendishly laughing， they had insisted on the low squalor， the nauseous ugliness of the nightmare. now， suddenly， they trumpeted a call to arms. “o brave new world！” miranda was proclaiming the possibility of loveliness， the possibility of transforming even the nightmare into something fine and noble. “o brave new world！” it was a challenge， a command.

　　“no shoving there now！” shouted the deputy sub-bursar in a fury. he slammed down he lid of his cash-box. “i shall stop the distribution unless i have good behaviour.”

　　the deltas muttered， jostled one another a little， and then were still. the threat had been effective. deprivation of soma–appalling thought！

　　“that’s better，” said the young man， and reopened his cash-box.

　　linda had been a slave， linda had died； others should live in freedom， and the world be made beautiful. a reparation， a duty. and suddenly it was luminously clear to the savage what he must do； it was as though a shutter had been opened， a curtain drawn back.

　　“now，” said the deputy sub-bursar.

　　another khaki female stepped forward.

　　“stop！” called the savage in a loud and ringing voice. “stop！”

　　he pushed his way to the table； the deltas stared at him with astonishment.

　　“ford！” said the deputy sub-bursar， below his breath. “it’s the savage.” he felt scared.

　　“listen， i beg of you，” cried the savage earnestly. “lend me your ears…” he had never spoken in public before， and found it very difficult to express what he wanted to say. “don’t take that horrible stuff. it’s poison， it’s poison.”

　　“i say， mr. savage，” said the deputy sub-bursar， smiling propitiatingly. “would you mind letting me…”

　　“poison to soul as well as body.”

　　“yes， but let me get on with my distribution， won’t you？ there’s a good fellow.” with the cautious tenderness of one who strokes a notoriously vicious animal， he patted the savage’s arm. “just let me…”

　　“never！” cried the savage.

　　“but look here， old man…”

　　“throw it all away， that horrible poison.”

　　the words “throw it all away” pierced through the enfolding layers of incomprehension to the quick of the delta’s consciousness. an angry murmur went up from the crowd.

　　“i come to bring you freedom，” said the savage， turning back towards the twins. “i come…”

　　the deputy sub-bursar heard no more； he had slipped out of the vestibule and was looking up a number in the telephone book.

　　“not in his own rooms，” bernard summed up. “not in mine， not in yours. not at the aphroditaum； not at the centre or the college. where can he have got to？”

　　helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. they had come back from their work expecting to find the savage waiting for them at one or other of the usual meeting-places， and there was no sign of the fellow. which was annoying， as they had meant to nip across to biarritz in helmholtz’s four-seater sporticopter. they’d be late for dinner if he didn’t come soon.

　　“we’ll give him five more minutes，” said helmholtz. “if he doesn’t turn up by then， we’ll…”

　　the ringing of the telephone bell interrupted him. he picked up the receiver. “hullo. speaking.” then， after a long interval of listening， “ford in flivver！” he swore. “i’ll come at once.”

　　“what is it？” bernard asked.

　　“a fellow i know at the park lane hospital，” said helmholtz. “the savage is there. seems to have gone mad. anyhow， it’s urgent. will you come with me？”

　　together they hurried along the corridor to the lifts.

　　“but do you like being slaves？” the savage was saying as they entered the hospital. his face was flushed， his eyes bright with ardour and indignation. “do you like being babies？ yes， babies. mewling and puking，” he added， exasperated by their bestial stupidity into throwing insults at those he had come to save. the insults bounced off their carapace of thick stupidity； they stared at him with a blank expression of dull and sullen resentment in their eyes. “yes， puking！” he fairly shouted. grief and remorse， compassion and duty–all were forgotten now and， as it were， absorbed into an intense overpowering hatred of these less than human monsters. “don’t you want to be free and men？ don’t you even understand what manhood and freedom are？” rage was making him fluent； the words came easily， in a rush. “don’t you？” he repeated， but got no answer to his question. “very well then，” he went on grimly. “i’ll teach you； i’ll make you be free whether you want to or not.” and pushing open a window that looked on to the inner court of the hospital， he began to throw the little pill-boxes of soma tablets in handfuls out into the area.

　　for a moment the khaki mob was silent， petrified， at the spectacle of this wanton sacrilege， with amazement and horror.

　　“he’s mad，” whispered bernard， staring with wide open eyes. “they’ll kill him. they’ll…” a great shout suddenly went up from the mob； a wave of movement drove it menacingly towards the savage. “ford help him！” said bernard， and averted his eyes.

　　“ford helps those who help themselves.” and with a laugh， actually a laugh of exultation， helmholtz watson pushed his way through the crowd.

　　“free， free！” the savage shouted， and with one hand continued to throw the soma into the area while， with the other， he punched the indistinguishable faces of his assailants. “free！” and suddenly there was helmholtz at his side–  “good old helmholtz！” –also punching– “men at last！” –and in the interval also throwing the poison out by handfuls through the open window. “yes， men！ men！” and there was no more poison left. he picked up the cash-box and showed them its black emptiness. “you’re free！”

　　howling， the deltas charged with a redoubled fury.

　　hesitant on the fringes of the battle. “they’re done for，” said bernard and， urged by a sudden impulse， ran forward to help them； then thought better of it and halted； then， ashamed， stepped forward again； then again thought better of it， and was standing in an agony of humiliated indecision–thinking that they might be killed if he didn’t help them， and that he might be killed if he did–when （ford be praised！）， goggle-eyed and swine-snouted in their gas-masks， in ran the police.

　　bernard dashed to meet them. he waved his arms； and it was action， he was doing something. he shouted “help！” several times， more and more loudly so as to give himself the illusion of helping. “help！ help！ help！”

　　the policemen pushed him out of the way and got on with their work. three men with spraying machines buckled to their shoulders pumped thick clouds of soma vapour into the air. two more were busy round the portable synthetic music box. carrying water pistols charged with a powerful an？sthetic， four others had pushed their way into the crowd and were methodically laying out， squirt by squirt， the more ferocious of the fighters.

　　“quick， quick！” yelled bernard. “they’ll be killed if you don’t hurry. they’ll…oh！” annoyed by his chatter， one of the policemen had given him a shot from his water pistol. bernard stood for a second or two wambling unsteadily on legs that seemed to have lost their bones， their tendons， their muscles， to have become mere sticks of jelly， and at last not even jelly-water： he tumbled in a heap on the floor.

　　suddenly， from out of the synthetic music box a voice began to speak. the voice of reason， the voice of good feeling. the sound-track roll was unwinding itself in synthetic anti-riot speech number two （medium strength）. straight from the depths of a non-existent heart， “my friends， my friends！” said the voice so pathetically， with a note of such infinitely tender reproach that， behind their gas masks， even the policemen’s eyes were momentarily dimmed with tears， “what is the meaning of this？ why aren’t you all being happy and good together？ happy and good，” the voice repeated. “at peace， at peace.” it trembled， sank into a whisper and momentarily expired. “oh， i do want you to be happy，” it began， with a yearning earnestness. “i do so want you to be good！ please， please be good and…”

　　two minutes later the voice and the soma vapour had produced their effect. in tears， the deltas were kissing and hugging one another–half a dozen twins at a time in a comprehensive embrace. even helmholtz and the savage were almost crying. a fresh supply of pill-boxes was brought in from the bursary； a new distribution was hastily made and， to the sound of the voice’s ricuy affectionate， baritone valedictions， the twins dispersed， blubbering as though their hearts would break. “good-bye， my dearest， dearest friends， ford keep you！ good-bye， my dearest， dearest friends， ford keep you. good-bye my dearest， dearest…”

　　when the last of the deltas had gone the policeman switched off the current. the angelic voice fell silent.

　　“will you come quietly？” asked the sergeant， “or must we an？sthetize？” he pointed his water pistol menacingly.

　　“oh， we’ll come quietly，” the savage answered， dabbing alternately a cut lip， a scratched neck， and a bitten left hand.

　　still keeping his handkerchief to his bleeding nose helmholtz nodded in confirmation.

　　awake and having recovered the use of his legs， bernard had chosen this moment to move as inconspicuously as he could towards the door.

　　“hi， you there，” called the sergeant， and a swine-masked policeman hurried across the room and laid a hand on the young man’s shoulder.

　　bernard turned with an expression of indignant innocence. escaping？ he hadn’t dreamed of such a thing. “though what on earth you want me for，” he said to the sergeant， “i really can’t imagine.”

　　“you’re a friend of the prisoner’s， aren’t you？”

　　“well…” said bernard， and hesitated. no， he really couldn’t deny it. “why shouldn’t i be？” he asked.

　　“come on then，” said the sergeant， and led the way towards the door and the waiting police car.

第88章 Chapter Sixteen(1)


　　the room into which the three were ushered was the controller’s study.

　　“his fordship will be down in a moment.” the gamma butler left them to themselves.

　　helmholtz laughed aloud.

　　“it’s more like a caffeine-solution party than a trial，” he said， and let himself fall into the most luxurious of the pneumatic arm-chairs. “cheer up， bernard，” he added， catching sight of his friend’s green unhappy face. but bernard would not be cheered； without answering， without even looking at helmholtz， he went and sat down on the most uncomfortable chair in the room， carefully chosen in the obscure hope of somehow deprecating the wrath of the higher powers.

　　the savage meanwhile wandered restlessly round the room， peering with a vague superficial inquisitiveness at the books in the shelves， at the sound-track rolls and reading machine bobbins in their numbered pigeon-holes. on the table under the window lay a massive volume bound in limp black leather-surrogate， and stamped with large golden t’s. he picked it up and opened it. my life and work， by our ford. the book had been published at detroit by the society for the propagation of fordian knowledge. idly he turned the pages， read a sentence here， a paragraph there， and had just come to the conclusion that the book didn’t interest him， when the door opened， and the resident world controller for western europe walked briskly into the room.

　　mustapha mond shook hands with all three of them； but it was to the savage that he addressed himself. “so you don’t much like civilization， mr. savage，” he said.

　　the savage looked at him. he had been prepared to lie， to bluster， to remain sullenly unresponsive； but， reassured by the good-humoured intelligence of the controller’s face， he decided to tell the truth， straightforwardly. “no.” he shook his head.

　　bernard started and looked horrified. what would the controller think？ to be labelled as the friend of a man who said that he didn’t like civilization–said it openly and， of all people， to the controller–it was terrible. “but， john，” he began. a look from mustapha mond reduced him to an abject silence.

　　“of course，” the savage went on to admit， “there are some very nice things. all that music in the air， for instance…”

　　“sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears and sometimes voices.”

　　the savage’s face lit up with a sudden pleasure. “have you read it too？” he asked. “i thought nobody knew about that book here， in england.”

　　“almost nobody. i’m one of the very few. it’s prohibited， you see. but as i make the laws here， i can also break them. with impunity， mr. marx，” he added， turning to bernard. “which i’m afraid you can’t do.”

　　bernard sank into a yet more hopeless misery.

　　“but why is it prohibited？” asked the savage. in the excitement of meeting a man who had read shakespeare he had momentarily forgotten everything else.

　　the controller shrugged his shoulders. “because it’s old； that’s the chief reason. we haven’t any use for old things here.”

　　“even when they’re beautiful？”

　　“particularly when they’re beautiful. beauty’s attractive， and we don’t want people to be attracted by old things. we want them to like the new ones.”

　　“but the new ones are so stupid and horrible. those plays， where there’s nothing but helicopters flying about and you feel the people kissing.” he made a grimace. “goats and monkeys！” only in othello’s word could he find an adequate vehicle for his contempt and hatred.

　　“nice tame animals， anyhow，” the controller murmured parenthetically.

　　“why don’t you let them see othello instead？”

　　“i’ve told you； it’s old. besides， they couldn’t understand it.”

　　yes， that was true. he remembered how helmholtz had laughed at romeo and juliet. “well then，” he said， after a pause， “something new that’s like othello， and that they could understand.”

　　“that’s what we’ve all been wanting to write，” said helmholtz， breaking a long silence.

　　“and it’s what you never will write，” said the controller. “because， if it were really like othello nobody could understand it， however new it might be. and if were new， it couldn’t possibly be like othello.”

　　“why not？”

　　“yes， why not？” helmholtz repeated. he too was forgetting the unpleasant realities of the situation. green with anxiety and apprehension， only bernard remembered them； the others ignored him. “why not？”

　　“because our world is not the same as othello’s world. you can’t make flivvers without steel–and you can’t make tragedies without social instability. the world’s stable now. people are happy； they get what they want， and they never want what they can’t get. they’re well off； they’re safe； they’re never ill； they’re not afraid of death； they’re blissfully ignorant of passion and old age； they’re plagued with no mothers or fathers； they’ve got no wives， or children， or lovers to feel strongly about； they’re so conditioned that they practically can’t help behaving as they ought to behave. and if anything should go wrong， there’s soma. which you go and chuck out of the window in the name of liberty， mr. savage. liberty！” he laughed. “expecting deltas to know what liberty is！ and now expecting them to understand othello！ my good boy！”

　　the savage was silent for a little. “all the same，” he insisted obstinately， “othello’s good， othello’s better than those feelies.”

　　“of course it is，” the controller agreed. “but that’s the price we have to pay for stability. you’ve got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. we’ve sacrificed the high art. we have the feelies and the scent organ instead.”

　　“but they don’t mean anything.”

　　“they mean themselves； they mean a lot of agreeable sensations to the audience.”

　　“but they’re…they’re told by an idiot.”

　　the controller laughed. “you’re not being very polite to your friend， mr. watson. one of our most distinguished emotional engineers…”

　　“but he’s right，” said helmholtz gloomily. “because it is idiotic. writing when there’s nothing to say…”

　　“precisely. but that require the most enormous ingenuity. you’re making fiivvers out of the absolute minimum of steel–works of art out of practically nothing but pure sensation.”

　　the savage shook his head. “it all seems to me quite horrible.”

第89章 Chapter Sixteen(2)


　　“of course it does. actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. and， of course， stability isn’t nearly so spectacular as instability. and being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune， none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation， or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. happiness is never grand.”

　　“i suppose not，” said the savage after a silence. “but need it be quite so bad as those twins？” he passed his hand over his eyes as though he were trying to wipe away the remembered image of those long rows of identical midgets at the assembling tables， those queued-up twin-herds at the entrance to the brentford monorail station， those human maggots swarming round linda’s bed of death， the endlessly repeated face of his assailants. he looked at his bandaged left hand and shuddered. “horrible！”

　　“but how useful！ i see you don’t like our bokanovsky groups； but， i assure you， they’re the foundation on which everything else is built. they’re the gyroscope that stabilizes the rocket plane of state on its unswerving course.” the deep voice thrillingly vibrated； the gesticulating hand implied all space and the onrush of the irresistible machine. mustapha mond’s oratory was almost up to synthetic standards.

　　“i was wondering，” said the savage， “why you had them at all–seeing that you can get whatever you want out of those bottles. why don’t you make everybody an alpha double plus while you’re about it？”

　　mustapha mond laughed. “because we have no wish to have our throats cut，” he answered. “we believe in happiness and stability. a society of alphas couldn’t fail to be unstable and miserable. imagine a factory staffed by alphas–that is to say by separate and unrelated individuals of good heredity and conditioned so as to be capable （within limits） of making a free choice and assuming responsibilities. imagine it！” he repeated.

　　the savage tried to imagine it， not very successfully.

　　“it’s an absurdity. an alpha-decanted， alpha-conditioned man would go mad if he had to do epsilon semi-moron work–go mad， or start smashing things up. alphas can be completely socialized–but only on condition that you make them do alpha work. only an epsilon can be expected to make epsilon sacrifices， for the good reason that for him they aren’t sacrifices； they’re the line of least resistance. his conditioning has laid down rails along which he’s got to run. he can’t help himself； he’s foredoomed. even after decanting， he’s still inside a bottle–an invisible bottle of infantile and embryonic fixations. each one of us， of course，” the controller meditatively continued， “goes through life inside a bottle. but if we happen to be alphas， our bottles are， relatively speaking， enormous. we should suffer acutely if we were confined in a narrower space. you cannot pour upper-caste champagne-surrogate into lower-caste bottles. it’s obvious theoretically. but it has also been proved in actual practice. the result of the cyprus experiment was convincing.”

　　“what was that？” asked the savage.

　　mustapha mond smiled. “well， you can call it an experiment in rebottling if you like. it began in a.f. 473. the controllers had the island of cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand alphas. all agricultural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own affairs. the result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical prediotions. the land wasn’t properly worked； there were strikes in all the factories； the laws were set at naught， orders disobeyed； all the people detailed for a spell of low-grade work were perpetually intriguing for high-grade jobs， and all the people with high-grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they were. within six years they were having a first-class civil war. when nineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed， the survivors unanimously petitioned the world controllers to resume the government of the island. which they did. and that was the end of the only society of alphas that the world has ever seen.”

　　the savage sighed， profoundly.

　　“the optimum population，” said mustapha mond， “is modelled on the iceberg–eight-ninths below the water line， one-ninth above.”

　　“and they’re happy below the water line？”

　　“happier than above it. happier than your friend here， for example.” he pointed.

　　“in spite of that awful work？”

　　“awful？ they don’t find it so. on the contrary， they like it. it’s light， it’s childishly simple. no strain on the mind or the muscles. seven and a half hours of mild， unexhausting labour， and then the soma ration and games and unrestricted copulation and the feelies. what more can they ask for？ true，” he added， “they might ask for shorter hours. and of course we could give them shorter hours. technically， it would be perfectly simple to reduce all lower-caste working hours to three or four a day. but would they be any the happier for that？ no， they wouldn’t. the experiment was tried， more than a century and a half ago. the whole of ireland was put on to the four-hour day. what was the result？ unrest and a large increase in the consumption of soma； that was all. those three and a half hours of extra leisure were so far from being a source of happiness， that people felt constrained to take a holiday from them. the inventions office is stuffed with plans for labour-saving processes. thousands of them.” mustapha mond made a lavish gesture. “and why don’t we put them into execution？ for the sake of the labourers； it would be sheer cruelty to afflict them with excessive leisure. it’s the same with agriculture. we could synthesize every morsel of food， if we wanted to. but we don’t. we prefer to keep a third of the population on the land. for their own sakes–because it takes longer to get food out of the land than out of a factory. besides， we have our stability to think of. we don’t want to change. every change is a menace to stability. that’s another reason why we’re so chary of applying new inventions. every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive； even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy. yes， even science.”

第90章 Chapter Sixteen(3)


　　science？ the savage frowned. he knew the word. but what it exactly signified he could not say. shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo had never mentioned science， and from linda he had only gathered the vaguest hints： science was something you made helicopters with， some thing that caused you to laugh at the corn dances， something that prevented you from being wrinkled and losing your teeth. he made a desperate effort to take the controller’s meaning.

　　“yes，” mustapha mond was saying， “that’s another item in the cost of stability. it isn’t only art that’s incompatible with happiness； it’s also science. science is dangerous； we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.”

　　“what？” said helmholtz， in astonishment. “but we’re always saying that science is everything. it’s a hypnop？dic platitude.”

　　“three times a week between thirteen and seventeen，” put in bemard.

　　“and all the science propaganda we do at the college…”

　　“yes； but what sort of science？” asked mustapha mond sarcastically. “you’ve had no scientific training， so you can’t judge. i was a pretty good physicist in my time. too good–good enough to realize that all our science is just a cookery book， with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody’s allowed to question， and a list of recipes that mustn’t be added to except by special permission from the head cook. i’m the head cook now. but i was an inquisitive young scullion once. i started doing a bit of cooking on my own. unorthodox cooking， illicit cooking. a bit of real science， in fact.” he was silent.

　　“what happened？” asked helmholtz watson.

　　the controller sighed. “very nearly what’s going to happen to you young men. i was on the point of being sent to an island.”

　　the words galvanized bernard into violent and unseemly activity. “send me to an island？” he jumped up， ran across the room， and stood gesticulating in front of the controller. “you can’t send me. i haven’t done anything. lt was the others. i swear it was the others.” he pointed accusingly to helmholtz and the savage. “oh， please don’t send me to iceland. i promise i’ll do what i ought to do. give me another chance. please give me another chance.” the tears began to flow. “i tell you， it’s their fault，” he sobbed. “and not to iceland. oh please， your fordship， please…” and in a paroxysm of abjection he threw himself on his knees before the controller. mustapha mond tried to make him get up； but bernard persisted in his grovelling； the stream of words poured out inexhaustibly. in the end the controller had to ring for his fourth secretary.

　　“bring three men，” he ordered， “and take mr. marx into a bedroom. give him a good soma vaporization and then put him to bed and leave him.”

　　the fourth secretary went out and returned with three green-uniformed twin footmen. still shouting and sobbing. bernard was carried out.

　　“one would think he was going to have his throat cut，” said the controller， as the door closed. “whereas， if he had the smallest sense， he’d understand that his punishment is really a reward. he’s being sent to an island. that’s to say， he’s being sent to a place where he’ll meet the most interesting set of men and women to be found anywhere in the world. all the people who， for one reason or another， have got too self-consciously individual to fit into community-life. all the people who aren’t satisfied with orthodoxy， who’ve got independent ideas of their own. every one， in a word， who’s any one. i almost envy you， mr. watson.”

　　helmholtz laughed. “then why aren’t you on an island yourself？”

第91章 Chapter Sixteen(4)


　　“because， finally， i preferred this，” the controller answered. “i was given the choice： to be sent to an island， where i could have got on with my pure science， or to be taken on to the controllers’ council with the prospect of succeeding in due course to an actual controllership. i chose this and let the science go.” after a little silence， “sometimes，” he added， “i rather regret the science. happiness is a hard master–particularly other people’s happiness. a much harder master， if one isn’t conditioned to accept it unquestioningly， than truth.” he sighed， fell silent again， then continued in a brisker tone， “well， duty’s duty. one can’t consult one’s own preference. i’m interested in truth， i like science. but truth’s a menace， science is a public danger. as dangerous as it’s been beneficent. it has given us the stablest equilibrium in history. china’s was hopelessly insecure by comparison； even the primitive matriarchies weren’t steadier than we are. thanks， l repeat， to science. but we can’t allow science to undo its own good work. that’s why we so carefully limit the scope of its researches–that’s why i almost got sent to an island. we don’t allow it to deal with any but the most immediate problems of the moment. all other enquiries are most sedulously discouraged. it’s curious.”

　　he went on after a little pause， “to read what people in the time of our ford used to write about scientific progress. they seemed to have imagined that it could be allowed to go on indefinitely， regardless of everything else. knowledge was the highest good， truth the supreme value； all the rest was secondary and subordinate. true， ideas were beginning to change even then. our ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. mass production demanded the shift. universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning； truth and beauty can’t. and， of course， whenever the masses seized political power， then it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered. still， in spite of everything， unrestricted scientific research was still permitted. people still went on talking about truth and beauty as though they were the sovereign goods. right up to the time of the nine years’ war. that made them change their tune all right. what’s the point of truth or beauty or knowledge when the anthrax bombs are popping all around you？ that was when science first began to be controlled–after the nine years’ war. people were ready to have even their appetites controlled then. anything for a quiet life. we’ve gone on controlling ever since. it hasn’t been very good for truth， of course. but it’s been very good for happiness. one can’t have something for nothing. happiness has got to be paid for. you’re paying for it， mr. watson–paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty. i was too much interested in truth； i paid too.”

　　“but you didn’t go to an island，” said the savage， breaking a long silence.

　　the controller smiled. “that’s how i paid. by choosing to serve happiness. other people’s–not mine. it’s lucky，” he added， after a pause， “that there are such a lot of islands in the world. i don’t know what we should do without them. put you all in the lethal chamber， i suppose. by the way， mr. watson， would you like a tropical climate？ the marquesas， for example； or samoa？ or something rather more bracing？”

　　helmholtz rose from his pneumatic chair. “i should like a thoroughly bad climate，” he answered. “i believe one would write better if the climate were bad. if there were a lot of wind and storms， for example…”

　　the controller nodded his approbation. “i like your spirit， mr. watson. i like it very much indeed. as much as i officially disapprove of it.” he smiled. “what about the falkland islands？”

　　“yes， i think that will do，” helmholtz answered. “and now， if you don’t mind， i’ll go and see how poor bernard’s getting on.”

第92章 Chapter Seventeen(1)


　　art， science–you seem to have paid a fairly high price for your happiness，“ said the savage， when they were alone. “anything else？”

　　“well， religion， of course，” replied the controller. “there used to be something called god–before the nine years’ war. but i was forgetting； you know all about god， i suppose.”

　　“well…” the savage hesitated. he would have liked to say something about solitude， about night， about the mesa lying pale under the moon， about the precipice， the plunge into shadowy darkness， about death. he would have liked to speak； but there were no words. not even in shakespeare.

　　the controller， meanwhile， had crossed to the other side of the room and was unlocking a large safe set into the wall between the bookshelves. the heavy door swung open. rummaging in the darkness within， “it’s a subject，” he said， “that has always had a great interest for me.” he pulled out a thick black volume. “you’ve never read this， for example.”

　　the savage took it. “the holy bible， containing the old and new testaments，” he read aloud from the title-page.

　　“nor this.” it was a small book and had lost its cover.

　　“the imitation of christ.”

　　“nor this.” he handed out another volume.

　　“the varieties of religious experience. by william james.”

　　“and i’ve got plenty more，” mustapha mond continued， resuming his seat. “a whole collection of pornographic old books. god in the safe and ford on the shelves.” he pointed with a laugh to his avowed library–to the shelves of books， the rack full of reading-machine bobbins and sound-track rolls.

　　“but if you know about god， why don’t you tell them？” asked the savage indignantly. “why don’t you give them these books about god？”

　　“for the same reason as we don’t give them othello： they’re old； they’re about god hundreds of years ago. not about god now.”

　　“but god doesn’t change.”

　　“men do， though.”

　　“what difference does that make？”

　　“all the difference in the world，” said mustapha mond. he got up again and walked to the safe. “there was a man called cardinal newman，” he said. “a cardinal，” he exclaimed parenthetically， “was a kind of arch-community-songster.”

　　“‘i pandulph， of fair milan， cardinal.’ i’ve read about them in shakespeare.”

　　“of course you have. well， as i was saying， there was a man called cardinal newman. ah， here’s the book.” he pulled it out. “and while i’m about it i’ll take this one too. it’s by a man called maine de biran. he was a philosopher， if you know what that was.”

　　“a man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and earth，” said the savage promptly.

　　“quite so. i’ll read you one of the things he did dream of in a moment. meanwhile， listen to what this old arch-community-songster said.” he opened the book at the place marked by a slip of paper and began to read. “‘we are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. we did not make ourselves， we cannot be supreme over ourselves. we are not our own masters. we are god’s property. is it not our happiness thus to view the matter？ is it any happiness or any comfort， to consider that we are our own？ it may be thought so by the young and prosperous. these may think it a great thing to have everything， as they suppose， their own way–to depend on no one–to have to think of nothing out of sight， to be without the irksomeness of continual acknowledgment， continual prayer， continual reference of what they do to the will of another. but as time goes on， they， as all men， will find that independence was not made for man–that it is an unnatural state–will do for a while， but will not carry us on safely to the end…’” mustapha mond paused， put down the first book and， picking up the other， turned over the pages. “take this， for example，” he said， and in his deep voice once more began to read： “‘a man grows old； he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness， of listlessness， of discomfort， which accompanies the advance of age； and， feeling thus， imagines himself merely sick， lulling his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause， from which， as from an illness， he hopes to recover. vain imaginings！ that sickness is old age； and a horrible disease it is. they say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. but my own experience has given me the conviction that， quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings， the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older； to develop because， as the passions grow calm， as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable， our reason becomes less troubled in its working， less obscured by the images， desires and distractions， in which it used to be absorbed； whereupon god emerges as from behind a cloud； our soul feels， sees， turns towards the source of all light； turns naturally and inevitably； for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us， now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without， we feel the need to lean on something that abides， something that will never play us false–a reality， an absolute and everlasting truth. yes， we inevitably turn to god； for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure， so delightful to the soul that experiences it， that it makes up to us for all our other losses.’”

　　mustapha mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. “one of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn’t dream about was this” （he waved his hand）， “us， the modern world. ‘you can only be independent of god while you’ve got youth and prosperity； independence won’t take you safely to the end.’ well， we’ve now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. what follows？ evidently， that we can be independent of god. ‘the religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.’ but there aren’t any losses for us to compensate； religious sentiment is superfluous. and why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires， when youthful desires never fail？ a substitute for distractions， when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last？ what need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity？ of consolation， when we have soma？ of something immovable， when there is the social order？”

　　“then you think there is no god？”

　　“no， i think there quite probably is one.”

　　“then why？…”

　　mustapha mond checked him. “but he manifests himself in different ways to different men. in premodern times he manifested himself as the being that’s described in these books. now…”

　　“how does he manifest himself now？” asked the savage.

　　“well， he manifests himself as an absence； as though he weren’t there at all.”

　　“that’s your fault.”

　　“call it the fault of civilization. god isn’t compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. you must make your choice. our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness. that’s why i have to keep these books locked up in the safe. they’re smut. people would be shocked it…”

　　the savage interrupted him. “but isn’t it natural to feel there’s a god？”

　　“you might as well ask if it’s natural to do up one’s trousers with zippers，” said the controller sarcastically. “you remind me of another of those old fellows called bradley. he defined philosophy as the finding of bad reason for what one believes by instinct. as if one believed anything by instinct！ one believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them. finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons–that’s philosophy. people believe in god because they’ve been conditioned to.”

　　“but all the same，” insisted the savage， “it is natural to believe in god when you’re alone–quite alone， in the night， thinking about death…”

　　“but people never are alone now，” said mustapha mond. “we make them hate solitude； and we arrange their lives so that it’s almost impossible for them ever to have it.”

　　the savage nodded gloomily. at malpais he had suffered because they had shut him out from the communal activities of the pueblo， in civilized london he was suffering because he could never escape from those communal activities， never be quietly alone.

　　“do you remember that bit in king lear？” said the savage at last. “‘the gods are just and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us； the dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes，’ and edmund answers–you remember， he’s wounded， he’s dying–‘thou hast spoken right； tis true. the wheel has come full circle； i am here.’ what about that now？ doesn’t there seem to be a god managing things， punishing， rewarding？”

　　“well， does there？” questioned the controller in his turn. “you can indulge in any number of pleasant vices with a freemartin and run no risks of having your eyes put out by your son’s mistress. ‘the wheel has come full circle； i am here.’ but where would edmund be nowadays？ sitting in a pneumatic chair， with his arm round a girl’s waist， sucking away at his sex-hormone chewing-gum and looking at the feelies. the gods are just. no doubt. but their code of law is dictated， in the last resort， by the people who organize society； providence takes its cue from men.”

　　“are you sure？” asked the savage. “are you quite sure that the edmund in that pneumatic chair hasn’t been just as heavily punished as the edmund who’s wounded and bleeding to death？ the gods are just. haven’t they used his pleasant vices as an instrument to degrade him？”

　　“degrade him from what position？ as a happy， hard-working， goods-consuming citizen he’s perfect. of course， if you choose some other standard than ours， then perhaps you might say he was degraded. but you’ve got to stick to one set of postulates. you can’t play electro-magnetic golf according to the rules of centrifugal bumble-puppy.”

　　“but value dwells not in particular will，” said the savage. “it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein ’tis precious of itself as in the prizer.”

　　“come， come，” protested mustapha mond， “that’s going rather far， isn’t it？”

　　“if you allowed yourselves to think of god， you wouldn’t allow yourselves to be degraded by pleasant vices. you’d have a reason for bearing things patiently， for doing things with courage. i’ve seen it with the indians.”

　　“i’m sure you have，” said mustapha mond. “but then we aren’t indians. there isn’t any need for a civilized man to bear anything that’s seriously unpleasant. and as for doing things–ford forbid that he should get the idea into his head. it would upset the whole social order if men started doing things on their own.”

　　“what about self-denial， then？ if you had a god， you’d have a reason for self-denial.”

　　“but industrial civilization is only possible when there’s no self-denial. self-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics. otherwise the wheels stop turning.”

　　“you’d have a reason for chastity！” said the savage， blushing a little as he spoke the words.

　　“but chastity means passion， chastity means neurasthenia. and passion and neurasthenia mean instability. and instability means the end of civilization. you can’t have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices.”

　　“but god’s the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. if you had a god…”

第94章 Chapter Seventeen(3)


　　“my dear young friend，” said mustapha mond， “civilization has absolutely no need of nobility or heroism. these things are symptoms of political inefficiency. in a properly organized society like ours， nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. where there are wars， where there are divided allegiances， where there are temptations to be resisted， objects of love to be fought for or defended–there， obviously， nobility and heroism have some sense. but there aren’t any wars nowadays. the greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much. there’s no such thing as a divided allegiance； you’re so conditioned that you can’t help doing what you ought to do. and what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant， so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play， that there really aren’t any temptations to resist. and if ever， by some unlucky chance， anything unpleasant should somehow happen， why， there’s always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. and there’s always soma to calm your anger， to reconcile you to your enemies， to make you patient and long-suffering. in the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. now， you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets， and there you are. anybody can be virtuous now. you can carry at least half your mortality about in a bottle. christianity without tears–that’s what soma is.”

　　“but the tears are necessary. don’t you remember what othello said？ ‘if after every tempest came such calms， may the winds blow till they have wakened death.’ there’s a story one of the old indians used to tell us， about the girl of mátaski. the young men who wanted to marry her had to do a morning’s hoeing in her garden. it seemed easy； but there were flies and mosquitoes， magic ones. most of the young men simply couldn’t stand the biting and stinging. but the one that could–he got the girl.”

　　“charming！ but in civilized countries，” said the controller， “you can have girls without hoeing for them， and there aren’t any flies or mosquitoes to sting you. we got rid of them all centuries ago.”

　　the savage nodded， frowning. “you got rid of them. yes， that’s just like you. getting rid of everytfung unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it. whether ’tis better in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune， or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them…but you don’t do either. neither suffer nor oppose. you just abolish the slings and arrows. it’s too easy.”

　　he was suddenly silent， thinking of his mother. in her room on the thirty-seventh floor， linda had floated in a sea of singing lights and perfumed caresses–floated away， out of space， out of time， out of the prison of her memories， her habits， her aged and bloated body. and tomakin， ex-director of hatcheries and conditioning， tomakin was still on holiday–on holiday from humiliation and pain， in a world where he could not hear those words， that derisive laughter， could not see that hideous face， feel those moist and flabby arms round his neck， in a beautiful world…

　　“what you need，” the savage went on， “is something with tears for a change. nothing costs enough here.”

　　（“twelve and a half million dollars，” henry foster had protested when the savage told him that. “twelve and a half million–that’s what the new conditioning centre cost. not a cent less.”）

　　“exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune， death and danger dare， even for an eggshell. isn’t there something in that？” he asked， looking up at mustapha mond. “quite apart from god–though of course god would be a reason for it. isn’t there something in living dangerously？”

　　“there’s a great deal in it，” the controller replied. “men and women must have their adrenals stimulated from time to time.”

　　“what？” questioned the savage， uncomprehending.

　　“it’s one of the conditions of perfect health. that’s why we’ve made the v.p.s. treatments compulsory.”

　　“v.p.s.？”

　　“violent passion surrogate. regularly once a month. we flood the whole system with adrenin. it’s the complete physiological equivalent of fear and rage. all the tonic effects of murdering desdemona and being murdered by othello， without any of the inconveniences.”

　　“but i like the inconveniences.”

　　“we don’t，” said the controller. “we prefer to do things comfortably.”

　　“but i don’t want comfort. i want god， i want poetry， i want real danger， i want freedom， i want goodness. i want sin.”

　　“in fact，” said mustapha mond， “you’re claiming the right to be unhappy.”

　　“all right then，” said the savage defiantly， “i’m claiming the nght to be unhappy.”

　　“not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent； the right to have syphilis and cancer； the right to have too little to eat； the right to be lousy； the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen to-morrow； the right to catch typhoid； the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.” there was a long silence.

　　“i claim them all，” said the savage at last.

　　mustapha mond shrugged his shoulders. “you’re welcome，” he said.

　　the door was ajar； they entered. “john！”

　　from the bathroom came an unpleasant and characteristic sound.

　　“is there anything the matter？” helmholtz called.

　　there was no answer. the unpleasant sound was repeated， twice； there was silence.

　　then， with a click the bathroom door opened and， very pale， the savage emerged. “i say，” helmholtz exclaimed solicitously， “you do look ill， john！” “did you eat something that didn’t agree with you？” asked bernard.

　　the savage nodded. “i ate civilization.”

　　“what？”

　　“it poisoned me； i was defiled. and then，” he added， in a lower tone， “i ate my own wickedness.”

　　“yes， but what exactly？…i mean， just now you were…”

　　“now i am purified，” said the savage. “i drank some mustard and warm water.”

　　the others stared at him in astonishment. “do you mean to say that you were doing it on purpose？” asked bernard.

　　“that’s how the indians always purify themselves.” he sat down and， sighing， passed his hand across his forehead. “i shall rest for a few minutes，” he said. “i’m rather tired.”

　　“well， i’m not surprised，” said helmholtz. after a silence， “we’ve come to say good-bye，” he went on in another tone. “we’re off to-morrow morning.”

　　“yes， we’re off to-morrow，” said bernard on whose face the savage remarked a new expression of determined resignation. “and by the way， john，” he continued， leaning forward in his chair and laying a hand on the savage’s knee， “i want to say how sorry i am about everything that happened yesterday.” he blushed. “how ashamed，” he went on， in spite of the unsteadiness of his voice， “how really…”

　　the savage cut him short and， taking his hand， affectionately pressed it.

　　“helmholtz was wonderful to me，” bernard resumed， after a little pause. “if it hadn’t been for him， i should…”

　　“now， now，” helmholtz protested.

　　there was a silence. in spite of their sadness–because of it， even； for their sadness was the symptom of their love for one another–the three young men were happy.

　　“i went to see the controller this morning，” said the savage at last.

　　“what for？”

　　“to ask if i mightn’t go to the islands with you.”

　　“and what did he say？” asked helmholtz eagerly.

　　the savage shook his head. “he wouldn’t let me.”

　　“why not？”

　　“he said he wanted to go on with the experiment. but i’m damned，” the savage added， with sudden fury， “i’m damned if i’ll go on being experimented with. not for all the controllers in the world. l shall go away to-morrow too.”

　　“but where？” the others asked in unison.

　　the savage shrugged his shoulders. “anywhere. i don’t care. so long as i can be alone.”

　　from guildford the down-line followed the wey valley to godalming， then， over milford and witley， proceeded to haslemere and on through petersfield towards portsmouth. roughly parallel to it， the upline passed over worplesden， tongham， puttenham， elstead and grayshott. between the hog’s back and hindhead there were points where the two lines were not more than six or seven kilometres apart. the distance was too small for careless flyers–particularly at night and when they had taken half a gramme too much. there had been accidents. serious ones. it had been decided to deflect the upline a few kilometres to the west. between grayshott and tongham four abandoned air-lighthouses marked the course of the old portsmouth-to-london road. the skies above them were silent and deserted. it was over selborne， bordon and farnham that the helicopters now ceaselessly hummed and roared.

　　the savage had chosen as his hermitage the old light-house which stood on the crest of the hill between puttenham and elstead. the building was of ferro-concrete and in excellent condition–almost too comfortable the savage had thought when he first explored the place， almost too civilizedly luxurious. he pacified his conscience by promising himself a compensatingly harder self-discipline， purifications the more complete and thorough. his first night in the hermitage was， deliberately， a sleepless one. he spent the hours on his knees praying， now to that heaven from which the guilty claudius had begged forgiveness， now in zu？i to awonawilona， now to jesus and pookong， now to his own guardian animal， the eagle. from time to time he stretched out his arms as though he were on the cross， and held them thus through long minutes of an ache that gradually increased till it became a tremulous and excruciating agony； held them， in voluntary crucifixion， while he repeated， through clenched teeth （the sweat， meanwhile， pouring down his face）， “oh， forgive me！ oh， make me pure！ oh， help me to be good！” again and again， till he was on the point of fainting from the pain.

　　when morning came， he felt he had earned the right to inhabit the lighthouse； yet， even though there still was glass in most of the windows， even though the view from the platform was so fine. for the very reason why he had chosen the lighthouse had become almost instantly a reason for going somewhere else. he had decided to live there because the view was so beautiful， because， from his vantage point， he seemed to be looking out on to the incarnation of a divine being. but who was he to be pampered with the daily and hourly sight of loveliness？ who was he to be living in the visible presence of god？ all he deserved to live in was some filthy sty， some blind hole in the ground. stiff and still aching after his long night of pain， but for that very reason inwardly reassured， he climbed up to the platform of his tower， he looked out over the bright sunrise world which he had regained the right to inhabit. on the north the view was bounded by the long chalk ridge of the hog’s back， from behind whose eastern extremity rose the towers of the seven skyscrapers which constituted guildford. seeing them， the savage made a grimace； but he was to become reconciled to them in course of time； for at night they twinued gaily with geometrical constellations， or else， flood-lighted， pointed their luminous fingers （with a gesture whose significance nobody in england but the savage now understood） solemnly towards the plumbless mysteries of heaven.

第96章 Chapter Eighteen(2)


　　in the valley which separated the hog’s back from the sandy hill on which the lighthouse stood， puttenham was a modest little village nine stories high， with silos， a poultry farm， and a small vitamin-d factory. on the other side of the lighthouse， towards the south， the ground fell away in long slopes of heather to a chain of ponds.

　　beyond them， above the intervening woods， rose the fourteen-story tower of elstead. dim in the hazy english air， hindhead and selborne invited the eye into a blue romantic distance. but it was not alone the distance that had attracted the savage to his lighthouse； the near was as seductive as the far. the woods， the open stretches of heather and yellow gorse， the clumps of scotch firs， the shining ponds with their overhanging birch trees， their water lilies， their beds of rushes–these were beautiful and， to an eye accustomed to the aridities of the american desert， astonishing. and then the solitude！ whole days passed during which he never saw a human being. the lighthouse was only a quarter of an hour’s flight from the charing-t tower； but the hills of malpais were hardly more deserted than this surrey heath. the crowds that daily left london， left it only to play electro-magnetic golf or tennis. puttenham possessed no links； the nearest riemann-surfaces were at guildford. flowers and a landscape were the only attractions here. and so， as there was no good reason for coming， nobody came. during the first days the savage lived alone and undisturbed.

　　of the money which， on his first arrival， john had received for his personal expenses， most had been spent on his equipment. before leaving london he had bought four viscose-woollen blankets， rope and string， nails， glue， a few tools， matches （though he intended in due course to make a fire drill）， some pots and pans， two dozen packets of seeds， and ten kilogrammes of wheat flour. “no， not synthetic starch and cotton-waste flour-substitute，” he had insisted. “even though it is more nourishing.” but when it came to pan-glandular biscuits and vitaminized beef-surrogate， he had not been able to resist the shopman’s persuasion. looking at the tins now， he bitterly reproached himself for his weakness. loathesome civilized stuff！ he had made up his mind that he would never eat it， even if he were starving. “that’ll teach them，” he thought vindictively. it would also teach him.

　　he counted his money. the little that remained would be enough， he hoped， to tide him over the winter. by next spring， his garden would be producing enough to make him independent of the outside world. meanwhile， there would always be game. he had seen plenty of rabbits， and there were waterfowl on the ponds. he set to work at once to make a bow and arrows.

　　there were ash trees near the lighthouse and， for arrow shafts， a whole copse full of beautifully straight hazel saplings. he began by felling a young ash， cut out six feet of unbranched stem， stripped off the bark and， paring by paring， shaved away the white wood， as old mitsima had taught him， until he had a stave of his own height， stiff at the thickened centre， lively and quick at the slender tips. the work gave him an intense pleasure. after those weeks of idleness in london， with nothing to do， whenever he wanted anything， but to press a switch or turn a handle， it was pure delight to be doing something that demanded skill and patience.

　　he had almost finished whittling the stave into shape， when he realized with a start that he was singing-singing！ it was as though， stumbling upon himself from the outside， he had suddenly caught himself out， taken himself flagrantly at fault. guiltily he blushed. after all， it was not to sing and enjoy himself that he had come here. it was to escape further contamination by the filth of civilized life； it was to be purified and made good； it was actively to make amends. he realized to his dismay that， absorbed in the whittling of his bow， he had forgotten what he had sworn to himself he would constantly remember–poor linda， and his own murderous unkindness to her， and those loathsome twins， swarming like lice across the mystery of her death， insulting， with their presence， not merely his own grief and repentance， but the very gods themselves. he had sworn to remember， he had sworn unceasingly to make amends. and there was he， sitting happily over his bow-stave， singing， actually singing.…

　　he went indoors， opened the box of mustard， and put some water to boil on the fire.

　　half an hour later， three delta-minus landworkers from one of the puttenham bokanovsky groups happened to be driving to elstead and， at the top of the hill， were astonished to see a young man standing outside the abandoned lighthouse stripped to the waist and hitting himself with a whip of knotted cords. his back was horizontally streaked with crimson， and from weal to weal ran thin trickles of blood. the driver of the lorry pulled up at the side of the road and， with his two companions， stared open-mouthed at the extraordinary spectacle. one， two three–they counted the strokes. after the eighth， the young man interrupted his self-punishment to run to the wood’s edge and there be violently sick. when he had finished， he picked up the whip and began hitting himself again. nine， ten， eleven， twelve…

　　“ford！” whispered the driver. and his twins were of the same opinion.

　　“fordey！” they said.

　　three days later， like turkey buzzards setthug on a corpse， the reporters came.

　　dried and hardened over a slow fire of green wood， the bow was ready. the savage was busy on his arrows. thirty hazel sticks had been whittled and dried， tipped with sharp nails， carefully nocked. he had made a raid one night on the puttenham poultry farm， and now had feathers enough to equip a whole armoury. it was at work upon the feathering of his shafts that the first of the reporters found him. noiseless on his pneumatic shoes， the man came up behind him.

　　“good-morning， mr. savage，” he said. “i am the representative of the hourly radio.”

　　startled as though by the bite of a snake， the savage sprang to his feet， scattering arrows， feathers， glue-pot and brush in all directions.

　　“i beg your pardon，” said the reporter， with genuine compunction. “i had no intention…” he touched his hat–the aluminum stove-pipe hat in which he carried his wireless receiver and transmitter. “excuse my not taking it off，” he said. “it’s a bit heavy. well， as i was saying， i am the representative of the hourly…”

　　“what do you want？” asked the savage， scowling. the reporter returned his most ingratiating smile.

　　“well， of course， our readers would be profoundly interested…” he put his head on one side， his smile became almost coquettish. “just a few words from you， mr. savage.” and rapidly， with a series of ritual gestures， he uncoiled two wires connected to the portable battery buckled round his waist； plugged them simultaneously into the sides of his aluminum hat； touched a spring on the crown–and antennae shot up into the air； touched another spring on the peak of the brim–and， like a jack-in-the-box， out jumped a microphone and hung there， quivering， six inches in front of his nose； pulled down a pair of receivers over his ears； pressed a switch on the left side of the hat-and from within came a faint waspy buzzing； turned a knob on the right–and the buzzing was interrupted by a stethoscopic wheeze and cackle， by hiccoughs and sudden squeaks. “hullo，” he said to the microphone， “hullo， hullo…” a bell suddenly rang inside his hat. “is that you， edzel？ primo mellon speaking. yes， i’ve got hold of him. mr. savage will now take the microphone and say a few words. won’t you， mr. savage？” he looked up at the savage with another of those winning smiles of his. “just tell our readers why you came here. what made you leave london （hold on， edzel！） so very suddenly. and， of course， that whip.” （the savage started. how did they know about the whip？） “we’re all crazy to know about the whip. and then something about civilization. you know the sort of stuff. ‘what i think of the civilized girl.’ just a few words， a very few…”

　　the savage obeyed with a disconcerting literalness. five words he uttered and no more-five words， the same as those he had said to bernard about the arch-community-songster of canterbury. “háni！ sons éso tse-ná！” and seizing the reporter by the shoulder， he spun him round （the young man revealed himself invitingly well-covered）， aimed and， with all the force and accuracy of a champion foot-and-mouth-baller， delivered a most prodigious kick.

　　eight minutes later， a new edition of the hourly radio was on sale in the streets of london. “hourly radio reporter has coccyx kicked by mystery savage，” ran the headlines on the front page. “sensation in surrey.”

　　“sensation even in london，” thought the reporter when， on his return， he read the words. and a very painful sensation， what was more. he sat down gingerly to his luncheon.

　　undeterred by that cautionary bruise on their colleague’s coccyx， four other reporters， representing the new york times， the frankfurt four-dimensional continuum， the fordian science monitor， and the delta mirror， called that afternoon at the lighthouse and met with receptions of progressively increasing violence.

　　from a safe distance and still rubbing his buttocks， “benighted fool！” shouted the man from the fordian science monitor， “why don’t you take soma？”

　　“get away！” the savage shook his fist.

　　the other retreated a few steps then turned round again. “evil’s an unreality if you take a couple of grammes.”

　　“kohakwa iyathtokyai！” the tone was menacingly derisive.

　　“pain’s a delusion.”

　　“oh， is it？” said the savage and， picking up a thick hazel switch， strode forward.

　　the man from the fordian science monitor made a dash for his helicopter.

　　after that the savage was left for a time in peace. a few helicopters came and hovered inquisitively round the tower. he shot an arrow into the importunately nearest of them. it pierced the aluminum floor of the cabin； there was a shrill yell， and the machine went rocketing up into the air with all the acceleration that its super-charger could give it. the others， in future， kept their distance respectfully. ignoring their tiresome humming （he likened himself in his imagination to one of the suitors of the maiden of mátsaki， unmoved and persistent among the winged vermin）， the savage dug at what was to be his garden. after a time the vermin evidently became bored and flew away； for hours at a stretch the sky above his head was empty and， but for the larks， silent.

　　the weather was breathlessly hot， there was thunder in the air. he had dug all the morning and was resting， stretched out along the floor. and suddenly the thought of lenina was a real presence， naked and tangible， saying “sweet！” and “put your arms round me！”–in shoes and socks， perfumed. impudent strumpet！ but oh， oh， her arms round his neck， the lifting of her breasts， her mouth！ eternity was in our lips and eyes. lenina…no， no， no， no！ he sprang to his feet and， half naked as he was， ran out of the house. at the edge of the heath stood a clump of hoary juniper bushes. he flung himself against them， he embraced， not the smooth body of his desires， but an armful of green spikes. sharp， with a thousand points， they pricked him. he tried to think of poor linda， breathless and dumb， with her clutching hands and the unutterable terror in her eyes. poor linda whom he had sworn to remember. but it was still the presence of lenina that haunted him. lenina whom he had promised to forget. even through the stab and stmg of the juniper needles， his wincing fiesh was aware of her， unescapably real. “sweet， sweet…and if you wanted me too， why didn’t you…”

　　the whip was hanging on a nail by the door， ready to hand against the arrival of reporters. in a frenzy the savage ran back to the house， seized it， whirled it. the knotted cords bit into his flesh.

　　“strumpet！ strumpet！” he shouted at every blow as though it were lenina （and how frantically， without knowing it， he wished it were）， white， warm， scented， infamous lenina that he was dogging thus. “strumpet！” and then， in a voice of despair， “oh， linda， forgive me. forgive me， god. i’m bad. i’m wicked. i’m…no， no， you strumpet， you strumpet！”

第98章 Chapter Eighteen(4)


　　from his carefully constructed hide in the wood three hundred metres away， darwin bonaparte， the feely corporation’s most expert big game photographer had watched the whole proceedings. patience and skill had been rewarded. he had spent three days sitting inside the bole of an artificial oak tree， three nights crawling on his belly through the heather， hiding microphones in gorse bushes， burying wires in the soft grey sand. seventy-two hours of profound discomfort. but now the great moment had come–the greatest， darwin bonaparte had time to reflect， as he moved among his instruments， the greatest since his taking of the famous all-howling stereoscopic feely of the gorillas’ wedding. “splendid，” he said to himself， as the savage started his astonishing performance. “splendid！” he kept his telescopic cameras carefully aimed–glued to their moving objective； clapped on a higher power to get a close-up of the frantic and distorted face （admirable！）； switched over， for half a minute， to slow motion （an exquisitely comical effect， he promised himself）； listened in， meanwhile， to the blows， the groans， the wild and raving words that were being recorded on the sound-track at the edge of his film， tried the effect of a little amplification （yes， that was decidedly better）； was delighted to hear， in a momentary lull， the shrill singing of a lark； wished the savage would turn round so that he could get a good close-up of the blood on his back–and almost instantly （what astonishing luck！） the accommodating fellow did turn round， and he was able to take a perfect close-up.

　　“well， that was grand！” he said to himself when it was all over. “really grand！” he mopped his face. when they had put in the feely effects at the studio， it would be a wonderful film. almost as good， thought darwin bonaparte， as the sperm whale’s love-life–and that， by ford， was saying a good deal！

　　twelve days later the savage of surrey had been released and could be seen， heard and felt in every first-class feely-palace in western europe.

　　the effect of darwin bonaparte’s film was immediate and enormous. on the afternoon which followed the evening of its release john’s rustic solitude was suddenly broken by the arrival overhead of a great swarm of helicopters.

　　he was digging in his garden–digging， too， in his own mind， laboriously turning up the substance of his thought. death–and he drove in his spade once， and again， and yet again. and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. a convincing thunder rumbled through the words. he lifted another spadeful of earth. why had linda died？ why had she been allowed to become gradually less than human and at last…he shuddered. a good kissing carrion. he planted his foot on his spade and stamped it fiercely into the tough ground. as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods； they kill us for their sport. thunder again； words that proclaimed themselves true–truer somehow than truth itself. and yet that same gloucester had called them ever-gentle gods. besides， thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provok’st； yet grossly fear’st thy death which is no more. no more than sleep. sleep. perchance to dream. his spade struck against a stone； he stooped to pick it up. for in that sleep of death， what dreams？…

　　a humming overhead had become a roar； and suddenly he was in shadow， there was something between the sun and him. he looked up， startled， from his digging， from his thoughts； looked up in a dazzled bewilderment， his mind still wandering in that other world of truer-than-truth， still focused on the immensities of death and deity； looked up and saw， close above him， the swarm of hovering machines. like locusts they came， hung poised， descended all around him on the heather. and from out of the bellies of these giant grasshoppers stepped men in white viscose-flannels， women （for the weather was hot） in acetate-shantung pyjamas or velveteen shorts and sleeveless， half-unzippered singlets–one couple from each. in a few minutes there were dozens of them， standing in a wide circle round the lighthouse， staring， laughing， clicking their cameras， throwing （as to an ape） peanuts， packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum， pan-glanduar petite beurres. and every moment–for across the hog’s back the stream of traffic now flowed unceasingly–their numbers increased. as in a nightmare， the dozens became scores， the scores hundreds.

　　the savage had retreated towards cover， and now， in the posture of an animal at bay， stood with his back to the wall of the lighthouse， staring from face to face in speechless horror， like a man out of his senses.

　　from this stupor he was aroused to a more immediate sense of reality by the impact on his cheek of a well-aimed packet of chewing-gum. a shock of startling pain–and he was broad awake， awake and fiercely angry.

　　“go away！” he shouted.

　　the ape had spoken； there was a burst of laughter and hand-clapping. “good old savage！ hurrah， hurrah！” and through the babel he heard cries of： “whip， whip， the whip！”

　　acting on the word’s suggestion， he seized the bunch of knotted cords from its nail behind the door and shook it at his tormentors.

　　there was a yell of ironical applause.

第99章 Chapter Eighteen(5)


　　menacingly he advanced towards them. a woman cried out in fear. the line wavered at its most immediately threatened point， then stiffened again， stood firm. the consciousness of being in overwhelming force had given these sightseers a courage which the savage had not expected of them. taken aback， he halted and looked round.

　　“why don’t you leave me alone？” there was an almost plaintive note in his anger.

　　“have a few magnesium-salted almonds！” said the man who， if the savage were to advance， would be the first to be attacked. he held out a packet. “they’re really very good， you know，” he added， with a rather nervous smile of propitation. “and the magnesium salts will help to keep you young.”

　　the savage ignored his offer. “what do you want with me？” he asked， turning from one grinning face to another. “what do you want with me？”

　　“the whip，” answered a hundred voices confusedly. “do the whipping stunt. let’s see the whipping stunt.”

　　then， in unison and on a slow， heavy rhythm， “we-want-the whip，” shouted a group at the end of the line. “we–want–the whip.”

　　others at once took up the cry， and the phrase was repeated， parrot-fashion， again and again， with an ever-growing volume of sound， until， by the seventh or eighth reiteration， no other word was being spoken. “we–want–the whip.”

　　they were all crying together； and， intoxicated by the noise， the unanimity， the sense of rhythmical atonement， they might， it seemed， have gone on for hours-almost indefinitely. but at about the twenty-fifth repetition the proceedings were startlingly interrupted. yet another helicopter had arrived from across the hog’s back， hung poised above the crowd， then dropped within a few yards of where the savage was standing， in the open space between the line of sightseers and the lighthouse. the roar of the air screws momentarily drowned the shouting； then， as the machine touched the ground and the engines were turned off： “we–want–the whip； we–want–the whip，” broke out again in the same loud， insistent monotone.

　　the door of the helicopter opened， and out stepped， first a fair and ruddy-faced young man， then， in green velveteen shorts， white shirt， and jockey cap， a young woman.

　　at the sight of the young woman， the savage started， recoiled， turned pale.

　　the young woman stood， smiling at him–an uncertain， imploring， almost abject smile. the seconds passed. her lips moved， she was saying something； but the sound of her voice was covered by the loud reiterated refrain of the sightseers.

　　“we–want–the whip！ we–want–the whip！”

　　the young woman pressed both hands to her left side， and on that peach-bright， doll-beautiful face of hers appeared a strangely incongrous expression of yearning distress. her blue eyes seemed to grow larger， brighter； and suddenly two tears rolled down her cheeks. inaudibly， she spoke again； then， with a quick， impassioned gesture stretched out her arms towards the savage， stepped forward.

　　“we–want–the whip！ we–want…”

　　and all of a sudden they had what they wanted.

　　“strumpet！” the savage had rushed at her like a madman. “fitchew！” like a madman， he was slashing at her with his whip of small cords.

　　terrified， she had turned to flee， had tripped and fallen in the heather. “henry， henry！” she shouted. but her ruddy-faced companion had bolted out of harm’s way behind the helicopter.

　　with a whoop of delighted excitement the line broke； there was a convergent stampede towards that magnetic centre of attraction. pain was a fascinating horror.

　　“fry， lechery， fry！” frenzied， the savage slashed again.

　　hungrily they gathered round， pushing and scrambling like swine about the trough.

　　“oh， the flesh！” the savage ground his teeth. this time it was on his shoulders that the whip descended. “kill it， kill it！”

　　drawn by the fascination of the horror of pain and， from within， impelled by that habit of cooperation， that desire for unanimity and atonement， which their conditioning had so ineradicably implanted in them， they began to mime the frenzy of his gestures， striking at one another as the savage struck at his own rebellious flesh， or at that plump incarnation of turpitude writhing in the heather at his feet.

　　“kill it， kill it， kill it…” the savage went on shouting.

　　then suddenly somebody started singing “orgy-porgy” and， in a moment， they had all caught up the refrain and， singing， had begun to dance. orgy-porgy， round and round and round， beating one another in six-eight time. orgy-porgy…

　　it was after midnight when the last of the helicopters took its flight. stupefied by soma， and exhausted by a long-drawn frenzy of sensuality， the savage lay sleeping in the heather. the sun was already high when he awoke. he lay for a moment， blinking in owlish incomprehension at the light； then suddenly remembered–everything.

　　“oh， my god， my god！” he covered his eyes with his hand.

　　that evening the swarm of helicopters that came buzzing across the hog’s back was a dark cloud ten kilometres long. the description of last night’s orgy of atonement had been in all the papers.

　　“savage！” called the first arrivals， as they alighted from their machine. “mr. savage！”

　　there was no answer.

　　the door of the lighthouse was ajar. they pushed it open and walked into a shuttered twilight. through an archway on the further side of the room they could see the bottom of the staircase that led up to the higher floors. just under the crown of the arch dangled a pair of feet.

　　“mr. savage！”

　　slowly， very slowly， like two unhurried compass needles， the feet turned towards the right； north， north-east， east， south-east， south， south-south-west； then paused， and， after a few seconds， turned as unhurriedly back towards the left. south-south-west， south， south-east， east.…
